    abstract = {Personal Rapid Transit ({PRT}) is an emerging urban transport mode. A {PRT} system operates much like a conventional hackney taxi system, except that the vehicles are driven by computer (no human driver) between stations in a dedicated network of guideways. The world's first two {PRT} systems began operating in 2010 and 2011. In both {PRT} and taxi systems, passengers request immediate service; they do not book ahead. Perfect information about future requests is therefore not available, but statistical information about future requests is available from historical data. If the system does not use this statistical information to position empty vehicles in anticipation of future requests, long passenger waiting times result, which makes the system less attractive to passengers, but using it gives rise to a difficult stochastic optimisation problem. This paper develops three lower bounds on achievable mean passenger waiting time, one based on queuing theory, one based on the static problem, in which it is assumed that perfect information is available, and one based on a Markov Decision Process model. An evaluation of these lower bounds, together with a practical heuristic developed previously, in simulation shows that these lower bounds can often be nearly attained, particularly when the fleet size is large. The results also show that low waiting times and high utilisation can be simultaneously obtained when the fleet size is large, which suggests important economies of scale.},

@article{Kek2006Relocation,
    abstract = {A shared-use vehicle system has a small number of vehicles reserved exclusively for use by a relatively larger group of members. Challenged by accessible and economical public transportation systems, multiple-station shared-use vehicle companies are driven to gain a competitive edge by using an operator-based relocation system to ensure privacy, simplicity, and convenience to their users. To help operators identify measures to maximize resources and enhance service levels, a simulation model is developed, with an emphasis on operator-based relocation techniques. A qualitative analysis conducted on operator-based relocation systems provides insights on the key issues involved and their influences over each other. On the basis of this analysis, a time-stepping simulation model is developed, and three performance indicators are proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of the different relocation techniques. The model has been validated by using commercially operational data from a local shared-use vehicle company. With the existing operational data as the base scenario, two proposed relocation techniques, namely, shortest time and inventory balancing techniques, and various operating parameters are studied. The simulation results have shown that if the inventory balancing relocation technique is used, the system can afford a 10\% reduction in car park lots and 25\% reduction in staff strength, generating cost savings of approximately 12.8\% without lowering the level of service for users.},

@article{Barth1999Simulation,
    abstract = {As an alternative transportation paradigm, shared vehicle systems have become increasingly popular in recent years. Shared vehicle systems typically consist of a fleet of vehicles that are used several times each day by different users. One of the main advantages of shared vehicle systems is that they reduce the number of vehicles required to meet total travel demand. An added energy/emissions benefit comes when low-polluting (e.g., electric) vehicles are used in the system. In order to evaluate operational issues such as vehicle availability, vehicle distribution, and energy management, a unique shared vehicle system computer simulation model has been developed. As an initial case study, the model was applied to a resort community in Southern California. The simulation model has a number of input parameters that allow for the evaluation of numerous scenarios. Several measures of effectiveness have been determined and are calculated to characterize the overall system performance. For the case study, it was found that the most effective number of vehicles (in terms of satisfying customer wait time) is in the range of 3–6 vehicles per 100 trips in a 24 h day. On the other hand, if the number of relocations also is to be minimized, there should be approximately 18–24 vehicles per 100 trips. Various inputs to the model were varied to see the overall system response. The model shows that the shared vehicle system is most sensitive to the vehicle-to-trip ratio, the relocation algorithm used, and the charging scheme employed when electric vehicles are used. A preliminary cost analysis was also performed, showing that such a system can be very competitive with present transportation systems (e.g., rental cars, taxies, etc.).},

@article{Conolly2002Doubleended,
    abstract = {The effect of  ” impatient” behaviour is studied primarily in the context of  ” double-ended” queues where each demands service from the other, typically taxis and passengers. Related models, single queue, and double, with a variety of mechanisms are considered.  ” Impatience” is to be understood in a wider context than simply becoming tired of waiting: it can arise because the customer, for some reason, runs out of time (inventory and organ transplantation), or because an alternative service becomes available (communication applications). The emphasis in this paper is theoretical but a brief numerical assessment of operational consequences is given. The  ” double-ended (or synchronization) queue” is a model for a variety of service demanding/providing systems. In an orderly taxi rank at a railway station or airport, on one side a queue is formed by the arrival of stream of passengers who wait for taxis to their destinations while on the other side a queue of taxis waiting for passengers. Obviously, the two queues can never coexist. The concept of  ” impatience” enters when a taxi or passenger leaves the queue before receiving service. This concept of  ” reneging” is widely applicable. In health care, for example, organs are stored for transplantation for needful patients. Both the organs and the demands for them have limited lifetime. A similar scenario applies to perishable inventory systems. In a similar manner, the real-time communication networks admit impatient behaviour. A typical example is a processor-shared queue in data networks with random time-out periods or deadlines. The paper sets out the basics in a variety of theoretical model settings with the common feature of exponential arrival, service and impatience mechanisms. A brief discussion based on numerical calculation is given of some operational features of the models but the thrust is on the theoretical techniques needed to make meaningful operational assessments.},

One of the major reasons why speech models, based on Markov chains, have not been developed until recently was the lack of a method for optimizing the parameters of the Markov model to match observed signal patterns. Such a method was proposed in the late 1960's and was immediately applied to speech processing in several research institutions. Continued refinements in the theory and implementation of Markov modelling techniques have greatly enhanced the method, leading to a wide range of applications of these models. It is the purpose of this tutorial paper to give an introduction to the theory of Markov models, and to illustrate how they have been applied to problems in speech recognition.},

@inproceedings{Salonidis2001Distributed,
    abstract = {Wireless ad hoc networks have been a growing area of research. While there has been considerable research on the topic of routing in such networks, the topic of topology creation has not received due attention. This is because almost all ad hoc networks to date have been built on top of a single channel, broadcast based wireless media, such as 802.11 or {IR} {LANs}. For such networks the distance relationship between the nodes implicitly (and uniquely) determines the topology of the ad hoc network. Bluetooth is a promising new wireless technology, which enables portable devices to form short-range wireless ad hoc networks and is based on a frequency hopping physical layer. This fact implies that hosts are not able to communicate unless they have previously discovered each other by synchronizing their frequency hopping patterns. Thus, even if all nodes are within direct communication range of each other, only those nodes which are synchronized with the transmitter can hear the transmission. To support any-to-any communication, nodes must be synchronized so that the pairs of nodes (which can communicate with each other) together form a connected graph. Using Bluetooth as an example, this paper first provides deeper insights into the issue to link establishment in frequency hopping wireless systems. It then introduces the Bluetooth topology construction protocol ({BTCP}), an asynchronous distributed protocol for constructing scatternets which starts with nodes that have no knowledge of their surroundings and terminates with the formation of a connected network satisfying all connectivity constraints posed by the Bluetooth technology. To the best of our knowledge, the work presented in this paper is the first attempt at building Bluetooth scatternets using distributed logic and is quite  ” practical” in the sense that it can be implemented using the communication primitives offered by the Bluetooth 1.0 specifications},

@article{Chakraborty2010Analysis,
    abstract = {Device discovery and connection establishment are fundamental to communication between two Bluetooth ({BT}) devices. In this paper, we give an analytical model of the time it takes for the master in a piconet to discover one slave. We show that, even in the absence of packet interference, the discovery time can be long in some instances. We have simulated the discovery protocol by actually implementing it to validate the analytical model. By means of simulations, we show how discovery time is affected by (i) the presence of multiple potential slaves, and (ii) changes in the maximum backoff limit. Using simulation studies we observed the effectiveness of two proposed improvements to device discovery, namely, (i) avoiding repetitions of the A and B trains before a train switch, and (ii) eliminating the idea of random backoff, or reducing the backoff limit. We show that discovery time can be reduced by avoiding repetitions of the A and B trains before a train switch. However, complete elimination of the random backoff is not a good idea, as discovery time will be too long when the number of {BT} devices is large. Instead, choosing a small backoff limit of 250---300 slots is highly effective in reducing discovery time even in the presence of a large number (say, 50) of potential slaves.},

@article{Yoh2011Hate,
    abstract = {A large and growing body of research suggests that transit users hate to wait. Given broad policy goals to increase public transit use in {U.S}. cities, this research sheds light on cost-effective ways to increase transit use by decreasing the perceived burdens of waiting at stops and stations. The goal of this study was to determine ( a ) the relative importance of stop and station amenities and attributes and ( b ) how the importance of these amenities and attributes varies with wait time. For this goal to be accomplished and for the duration of wait time when amenities become important to be determined a transit user survey that asked more than 2,000 travelers to rate both the importance of amenities at their stops or stations and their wait times was analyzed. Regardless of wait time, safety and on-time performance were paramount to riders; these also ranked highest relative to all other station and stop amenities examined. Lighting, cleanliness, information, shelter, and the presence of guards were less important to travelers when waits were short, but were more important with longer wait times. Thus, improving service frequency and reliability reduces the need for amenities at stations. This end suggests that when transit managers have a choice and when riders feel safe and secure managers should favor service improvements over station and stop amenities. Finally, some amenities become more important with long wait times, such as restrooms and food and drink facilities. Although provision of basic needs amenities is intuitive, restrooms and food and drink sales are most likely present at high-passenger-volume, high-service-frequency stops and stations, where they are valued least by travelers.},

@inproceedings{Geramifard2006Incremental,
    abstract = {Approximate policy evaluation with linear function approximation is a commonly arising problem in reinforcement learning, usually solved using temporal difference ({TD}) algorithms. In this paper we introduce a new variant of linear {TD} learning, called incremental least-squares {TD} learning, or {iLSTD}. This method is more data efficient than conventional {TD} algorithms such as {TD}(0) and is more computationally efficient than non-incremental least-squares {TD} methods such as {LSTD} (Bradtke \& Barto 1996; Boyan 1999). In particular, we show that the per-time-step complexities of {iLSTD} and {TD}(0) are O(n), where n is the number of features, whereas that of {LSTD} is O(n2). This difference can be decisive in modern applications of reinforcement learning where the use of a large number features has proven to be an effective solution strategy. We present empirical comparisons, using the test problem introduced by Boyan (1999), in which {iLSTD} converges faster than {TD}(0) and almost as fast as {LSTD}.},

Currently, {AGVs} are also used for repeating transportation tasks in other areas, such as warehouses, container terminals and external (underground) transportation systems. This paper discusses literature related to design and control issues of {AGV} systems at manufacturing, distribution, transshipment and transportation systems. It is concluded that most models can be applied for design problems at manufacturing centres. Some of these models and new models already proved to be successful in large {AGV} systems. In fact, new analytical and simulation models need to be developed for large {AGV} systems to overcome large computation times, {NP}-completeness, congestion, deadlocks and delays in the system and finite planning horizons. We specify more specific research perspectives in the design and control of {AGV} systems in distribution, transshipment and transportation systems.},

The decision to send a vehicle loaded or empty from one region to the next, arriving in the destination region at some point in the future, must anticipate the downstream impacts of the decision. The consequences of another load in a particular region at some point in the future, however, are highly uncertain. A simple methodology is proposed which calculates approximately the marginal value of an additional vehicle in each region in the future. This information is then used to generate a standard pure network which can be efficiently optimized to give dispatching decisions for today.},

    abstract = {We study integrality gaps and approximability of two closely related problems on directed graphs. Given a set V of n nodes in an underlying asymmetric metric and two specified nodes s and t, both problems ask to find an s-t path visiting all other nodes. In the asymmetric traveling salesman path problem ({ATSPP}), the objective is to minimize the total cost of this path. In the directed latency problem, the objective is to minimize the sum of distances on this path from s to each node. Both of these problems are {NP}-hard. The best known approximation algorithms for {ATSPP} had ratio O(log n) [7, 9] until the very recent result that improves it to O(log n/ log log n) [3, 9]. However, only a bound of O(√n) for the integrality gap of its linear programming relaxation has been known. For directed latency, the best previously known approximation algorithm has a guarantee of O(n1/2+ε), for any constant ε > 0 [23]. We present a new algorithm for the {ATSPP} problem that has approximation ratio of O(log n), but whose analysis also bounds the integrality gap of the standard {LP} relaxation of {ATSPP} by the same factor. This solves an open problem posed in [7]. We then pursue a deeper study of this {LP} and its variations and their use in approximating directed latency. Our second major result is an O(log n)-approximation to the directed latency problem. This also places an O(log n) bound on the integrality gap of a new {LP} relaxation of the latency problem that we introduce.},

@article{Kaplan2005Approximation,
    abstract = {A directed multigraph is said to be d-regular if the indegree and outdegree of every vertex is exactly d. By Hall's theorem, one can represent such a multigraph as a combination of at most n2 cycle covers, each taken with an appropriate multiplicity. We prove that if the d-regular multigraph does not contain more than ⌊d/2⌋ copies of any 2-cycle then we can find a similar decomposition into n2pairs of cycle covers where each 2-cycle occurs in at most one component of each pair. Our proof is constructive and gives a polynomial algorithm to find such a decomposition. Since our applications only need one such a pair of cycle covers whose weight is at least the average weight of all pairs, we also give an alternative, simpler algorithm to extract a single such {pair.This} combinatorial theorem then comes handy in rounding a fractional solution of an {LP} relaxation of the maximum Traveling Salesman Problem ({TSP}) problem. The first stage of the rounding procedure obtains two cycle covers that do not share a 2-cycle with weight at least twice the weight of the optimal solution. Then we show how to extract a tour from the 2 cycle covers, whose weight is at least 2/3 of the weight of the longest tour. This improves upon the previous 5/8 approximation with a simpler algorithm. Utilizing a reduction from maximum {TSP} to the shortest superstring problem, we obtain a 2.5-approximation algorithm for the latter problem, which is again much simpler than the previous {one.For} minimum asymmetric {TSP}, the same technique gives two cycle covers, not sharing a 2-cycle, with weight at most twice the weight of the optimum. Assuming triangle inequality, we then show how to obtain from this pair of cycle covers a tour whose weight is at most 0.842 log2n larger than optimal. This improves upon a previous approximation algorithm with approximation guarantee of 0.999 log2n. Other applications of the rounding procedure are approximation algorithms for maximum 3-cycle cover (factor 2/3, previously 3/5) and maximum asymmetric {TSP} with triangle inequality (factor 10/13, previously 3/4).},

@article{Gupta2010Inapproximability,
    abstract = {The {M/G}/K queueing system is one of the oldest models for multiserver systems and has been the topic of performance papers for almost half a century. However, even now, only coarse approximations exist for its mean waiting time. All the closed-form (nonnumerical) approximations in the literature are based on (at most) the first two moments of the job size distribution. In this paper we prove that no approximation based on only the first two moments can be accurate for all job size distributions, and we provide a lower bound on the inapproximability ratio, which we refer to as  the gap.  This is the first such result in the literature to address  the gap.  The proof technique behind this result is novel as well and combines mean value analysis, sample path techniques, scheduling, regenerative arguments, and asymptotic estimates. Finally, our work provides insight into the effect of higher moments of the job size distribution on the mean waiting time.},

@article{Boxma1979Approximations,

Special attention is paid to the case <{tex-math>\$G}\equiv D\$</tex-math>, i.e. constant service times. Most known approximations are in fact heavy traffic approximations which have rather large relative errors in the light traffic case. In the present study both the light traffic and heavy traffic behavior of {W<sub>Gs}</sub> ({W<sub>Ds}</sub>) are taken into account. In order to obtain mean waiting time approximations it appears to be useful to introduce a quantity (the "normed cooperation coefficient") which is inversely proportional to {W<sub>Gs}</sub> and which is in some sense a measure for the "cooperation" between the servers of the service facility. A part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of this normed cooperation coefficient.},

@phdthesis{Szillat2001Lowlevel,
    abstract = {This dissertation examines low-level control of an automated public transit system known as Personal Rapid Transit ({PRT}). This system consists of a large network of small (automobile-sized), computer-controlled vehicles. It provides passengers with ondemand, non-stop travel similar to a taxi. It should provide many benefits to individuals and society – greatly improved safety, reliability, and accessibility compared to the automotive system. Vehicles should also be more efficient in many respects: energy consumption, land usage, labour usage, and resource usage for construction of the system and vehicles. The idea dates back to at least the 1950's. Various concepts and early prototypes are presented. A fairly common goal for {PRT} systems is to operate large numbers of vehicles at close spacings, which introduces safety issues. This thesis is primarily concerned with  ” lowlevel” control – the safe motion of vehicles. Various safety concepts from other transit systems are examined. These are compared to the needs of {PRT}. A methodology called  ” model follower ” is selected. In it, vehicle controllers plan trajectories of future motion},

The story of Aramis is told by several different parties, none of which take precedence over any other: a young engineer and his professor, who act as detective to ferret out the reasons for the project's failure; company executives and elected officials; a sociologist; and finally Aramis itself, who delivers a passionate plea: technological innovation has needs and desires, especially a desire to be born, but cannot live without the sustained commitment of those who have created it.},

Vehicles are available on-demand rather than on fixed schedules. To date the system is still in the research stage. Performance parameters that are key to the design of operations are passenger waiting time at stations and the occurrence of wave-off events when a full station prevents an occupied vehicle from entering. The paper provides a methodology for the design of operations and discusses the sensitivity of the main performance parameters to transport demand. 1.},

The heuristics include pro-actively enforcing idleness of aircraft in creating the original schedule, strategically repositioning aircraft to serve yet-unknown demand and dense scheduling. Computational experiments are conducted in a simulator that mimics {FMCs}' daily operations. Simulation results quantify the value of each heuristic, which can be easily incorporated into existing computational methods used in {FMCs} for static scheduling problems.},

    abstract = {According to {U.S}. government surveys, 12\% of Americans used taxi service in the previous month' and spent about \$3.7 billion a year for cab fare.2 Taxi service is one of the major modes of public transportation. Despite providing services 24 hours a day, driving relentlessly with an empty taxicab in search of passengers and answering dispatch calls instantaneously, taxi service is ranked the most unsatisfactory mode of transportation by the public. Charging higher fares than other major modes of transportation and averaging 10 to 12 hours work day, taxi drivers have a difficult time to earn a sustainable {income.Approximately} half of all the taxi mileage is paid mileage; this means a significant portion of a taxi's time and fuel is spent on non-revenue generating activities, i.e. without passengers. Current taxi allocation is inefficient. The number of taxis and the geographical service areas which they serve are heavily regulated in most cities. With limited competition and strict regulations, taxi service suffers with customers having to endure long wait times and inferior services. The current taxi systems in most {U.S}. cities may be greatly improved from their current state. This thesis investigates the factors of inefficiency in the current taxi system, reviews previous taxi efficiency studies, and suggests possible solutions. After extensive literature reviews and field research, a computer simulation model has been built in the {MATLAB} environment. This computer model tests various attributes that affect logistic optimizations for taxi services. In particular, the effect of taxi fleet size, the quantity of hotspots, and the concentrations of customers at hotspots are analyzed in detail using the model. The metric of interest includes the customers' wait time, taxi revenue, and costs of operations. Results from the computer simulation experiments, field research, and literature review are analyzed and synthesized. Possible solutions are proposed as part of this thesis.},

@article{Lee2004Taxi,
    abstract = {The existing taxi dispatch system that taxi operators in Singapore use to handle current bookings was studied. This dispatch system adopts the Global Positioning System and is based on the nearest-coordinate method: the taxi assigned for each booking is the one with the shortest, direct, straight-line distance to the customer location. However, the taxi assigned under this system often is not capable of reaching the customer in the shortest time possible. An alternative dispatch system is proposed, whereby the dispatch of taxis is determined by real-time traffic conditions. In the proposed system, the taxi assigned the booking job is the one with the shortest time path, reaching the customer in the shortest time. This dispatch ensures that customers are served within the shortest period of time and increases customer satisfaction. The effectiveness of both the existing and the proposed dispatch systems is investigated through computer simulations. The results from a simulation model of the Singapore central business district network are presented and analyzed. Data from the simulations show that the proposed dispatch system is capable of being more efficient in dispatching taxis more quickly and leads to more than 50\% reductions in passenger pickup times and average travel distances. A more efficient dispatch system would result in higher standards of customer service and a more organized taxi fleet to meet customer demands better.},

@article{Seow2010Collaborative,
    abstract = {This paper presents a novel multiagent approach to automating taxi dispatch that services current bookings in a distributed fashion. The existing system in use by a taxi operator in Singapore and elsewhere, attempts to increase customer satisfaction locally, by sequentially dispatching nearby taxis to service customers. The proposed dispatch system attempts to increase customer satisfaction more globally, by concurrently dispatching multiple taxis to the same number of customers in the same geographical region, and  vis-à-vis  human driver satisfaction. To realize the system, a multiagent architecture is proposed, populated with software collaborative agents that can actively negotiate on behalf of taxi drivers in groups of size N for available customer bookings. Theoretically, an analysis of the boundary and optimal multiagent taxi-dispatch situations is presented along with a discussion of their implications. Experimentally, the operational efficiency of the existing and proposed dispatch systems was evaluated through computer simulations. The empirical results, obtained for a 1000-strong taxi fleet over a discrete range of N , show that the proposed system can dispatch taxis with reduction in customer waiting and empty taxi cruising times of up to 33.1\% and 26.3\%, respectively; and up to 41.8\% and 41.2\% reduction when a simple negotiation speedup heuristic was applied.},

@article{LeesMiller2010Theoretical,
    abstract = {A personal rapid transit system uses compact, computer-guided vehicles running on dedicated guideways to carry individuals or small groups directly between pairs of stations. Vehicles move on demand when a passenger requests service at his or her origin station. Because the number of trips requested from a station need not equal the number of trips ending there, some vehicles must run empty to balance the flows. The empty vehicle redistribution ({EVR}) problem is to decide which empty vehicles to move and when and where to move them; an {EVR} algorithm makes these decisions in real time, as passengers arrive and request service. A method was developed for finding the theoretical maximum demand (with a given spatial distribution) that a given system could serve with any {EVR} algorithm, which provides a benchmark against which particular {EVR} algorithms can be compared. The maximum passenger demand that a particular {EVR} algorithm can serve can be determined by simulation and then compared with the benchmark. The method is applied to two simple {EVR} heuristics on two example systems. The results suggest that this is a useful method for determining the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of {EVR} heuristics across a range of networks, passenger demands, and fleet sizes.},

    abstract = {Many problems in engineering, planning and manufacturing can be modeled as that of minimizing or maximizing a cost function over a finite set of discrete variables. This class of so-called combinatorial optimization problems has received much attention over the last two decades and major achievements have been made in its analysis (Papadimitriou and Steiglitz, 1982). One of these achievements is the separation of this class into two subclasses. The first one contains the problems that can be solved efficiently, i.e. problems for which algorithms are known that solve each instance to optimality in polynomial time. Examples are linear programming, matching and network problems. The second subclass contains the problems that are notoriously hard, formally referred to as {NP}-hard (see Chapter 11 for more details). For an {NP}-hard algorithm it is generally believed that no algorithm exists that solves each instance in polynomial time. Consequently, there are instances that require superpolynomial or exponential time to be solved to optimality. Many known problems belong to this class and probably the best known example is the traveling salesman problem. The above-mentioned distinction is supported by a general framework in computer science called complexity theory; for a detailed introduction and an extensive listing of provably hard problems see Garey and Johnson (1979) and Ausiello et al. (1999).},

@article{Yang2002Demandsupply,
    abstract = {This paper investigates the nature of demand–supply equilibrium in a regulated market for taxi service. Distinguished from conventional economic analysis, a network model is used to describe the demand and supply equilibrium of taxi services under fare structure and fleet size regulation in an either competitive or monopoly market. The spatial structure of the market such as the form of road network and the customer origin–destination demand pattern are explicitly considered. The model can determine a number of system performance measures at equilibrium such as utilization rate for taxi and level of service quality, and predict the effects of alternative regulations on system performance. The model can thus be used as a policy tool by the regulator to ascertain appropriate taxi regulations such as the selection of taxi fleet size and fare structure. A case study in Hong Kong was conducted to illustrate some interesting findings.},

    abstract = {This paper studies pricing and capacity decisions in markets for phone-ordered taxicabs. Taxi firms first choose capacities and then compete in prices. As firm demand increases, so does waiting time. This dampens competition and makes prices too high from the social point of view. Efficiency improves if firms choose large capacities. In a two-firm setting, equilibrium capacities are shown to be larger if both firms maximise total profits than if they maximise profits per cab. Hence, if fixed costs for entrant cabs are small, the market is more efficient in the former case. /// Dieser Aufsatz analysiert Preis- und Kapazit\"{a}tsentscheidungen im Markt der telefonisch bestellten Taxis. Taxiunternehmen f\"{a}llen erst die Kapazit\"{a}ts- und erst dann die Preisentscheidung. Bei Nachfragewachstum erh\"{o}ht sich zun\"{a}chst die Wartezeit und die Preise steigen auf ein Niveau jenseits des sozialen Optimums. Erst wenn die Unternehmen gr\"{o}{\ss}ere Kapazit\"{a}ten schaffen, steigt die Effizienz. In einem Modell mit zwei Taxibetrieben liegt die Gleichgewichtskapazit\"{a}t h\"{o}her, wenn beide Betriebe den Unternehmensgewinn maximieren als bei Maximierung des Gewinns pro Taxi. Folglich ist im ersteren Fall der Markt effizienter, solange die Fixkosten f\"{u}r neu in den Markt eintretende Taxis gering sind. /// Cet article \'{e}tudie les d\'{e}cisions de tarification et de capacit\'{e} dans des march\'{e}s pour taxis appel\'{e}s par t\'{e}l\'{e}phone.

    abstract = {The problem of taxi despatch from a pool of taxies, either waiting
at the taxi stand or plying free in the city is addressed. Calls for
taxies may emanate from different parts of the city. The taxi stand
operator is aware about the status (i.e. waiting, busy, free) and
position of all taxies associated with the taxi stand at any time. While
despatching the taxi for a call, the operator should consider its
vicinity with the calling point in order to reduce the service time. On
the other hand, the operator should be fair to all the taxi drivers, and
maintain proper distribution of opportunities to each one of them. Two
rules; `nearest vehicle first' and `least utilized vehicle first' are
normally used to meet the above objectives. However, both these
objectives cannot be simultaneously met with any one rule. In this paper
we propose a fuzzy combination of the two rules to fulfill both the
objectives at the same time. The fuzzy combination approach has the
potential to take many such contradicting parameters into simultaneous
consideration. A simulation model is also presented to demonstrate the
results of such fuzzy combination of rules},

    abstract = {We study the directed minimum latency problem: given an n-vertex asymmetric metric (V, d) with a root vertex r ∈ V, find a spanning path originating at r that minimizes the sum of latencies at all vertices (the latency of any vertex v ∈ V is the distance from r to v along the path). This problem has been well-studied on symmetric metrics, and the best known approximation guarantee is 3.59 [3]. For any 1 log n < ɛ < 1, we give an {nO}(1/ɛ) time algorithm for directed latency that achieves an approximation ratio of O(ρ · nɛ ɛ 3), where ρ is the integrality gap of an {LP} relaxation for the asymmetric traveling salesman path problem [13, 5]. We prove an upper bound ρ = O (  √ n), which implies (for any fixed ɛ> 0) a polynomial time O(n 1/2+ɛ)approximation algorithm for directed latency. In the special case of metrics induced by shortest-paths in an unweighted directed graph, we give an O(log 2 n) approximation algorithm. As a consequence, we also obtain an O(log 2 n) approximation algorithm for minimizing the weighted completion time in no-wait permutation flowshop scheduling. We note that even in unweighted directed graphs, the directed latency problem is at least as hard to approximate as the well-studied asymmetric traveling salesman problem, for which the best known approximation guarantee is O(log n). 1},

These systems typically evolve within a local service area over a  relatively short period of time (typically, a few hours), thus putting stringent  response time requirements on the decision maker.

Although the project was moderately successful, our focus is not on documenting the benefits, but rather on summarizing the challenges that arose. The most significant theme running through the implementation hurdles we encountered was the lack of information available to the model. Computers are very good at processing vast quantities of information; humans are very good at challenging the information that is in the computer and augmenting computer-provided data with head knowledge. Our study includes a careful comparison of actual decisions with model recommendations, using a six-month database of actual transactions. This comparison is the first we have seen of its kind and provides the most rigorous evaluation of an online dispatch model that we have seen. Although the model was well used, the results demonstrate that significant improvements could have been obtained if the level of model utilization had been even higher.},

Based on the booking surcharges, there are generally two categories of taxi bookings, current and advance. Current bookings are requests that taxi should reach the customer immediately or within half an hour, and advance bookings are requests made at least half an hour in advance. In this paper, a novel trip-chaining strategy for taxi advance booking based on a customized algorithm of Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Window ({PDPTW}) was proposed. The idea is to chain several bookings with demand time points which are spread out within a reasonable period of time, and with each pick-up point coinciding with or being within close proximity to the previous drop-off location. Based on the experimental results, the proposed system has the potential to improve the taxi booking service currently operating in Singapore.},

The reliability of this information about real-time traffic conditions, however, has not been investigated. This study examines the feasibility of using taxi dispatch systems as probes for real-time traffic surveillance. The examination focuses on the uncertainties in the data provided by the two types of wireless communications systemsanalog and digital Multi Channel Access ({MCA})that are used for dispatching taxis. The study reveals that the digital {MCA} wireless system is much better than the analog wireless system for data transmission. This article exemplified that selection of longer road segments helps to greatly reduce traffic surveillance errors. Finally, this article discusses the lessons learned from this study and the limitations that must be overcome before the system can be widely deployed.},

    abstract = {This paper analyses the stability and fairness of two classes of rate control algorithm for communication networks. The algorithms provide natural generalisations to large-scale networks of simple additive increase/multiplicative decrease schemes, and are shown to be stable about a system optimum characterised by a proportional fairness criterion. Stability is established by showing that, with an appropriate formulation of the overall optimisation problem, the network's implicit objective function provides a Lyapunov function for the dynamical system defined by the rate control algorithm. The network's optimisation problem may be cast in primal or dual form: this leads naturally to two classes of algorithm, which may be interpreted in terms of either congestion indication feedback signals or explicit rates based on shadow prices. Both classes of algorithm may be generalised to include routing control, and provide natural implementations of proportionally fair pricing.},

Here we consider applications in which {1s-AA} is not as close to the optimum and propose Amsaa, an anytime multi-step anticipatory algorithm. Amsaa combines techniques from three different fields to make decisions online. It uses the sampling average approximation method from stochastic programming to approximate the problem; solves the resulting problem using a search algorithm for Markov decision processes from artificial intelligence; and uses a discrete optimization algorithm for guiding the search. Amsaa was evaluated on a stochastic project scheduling application from the pharmaceutical industry featuring endogenous observations of the uncertainty. The experimental results show that Amsaa significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on this application under various time constraints.},

We have a single server that can move on the arcs of the graph, at unit speed, and that has to execute all of the jobs within their respective time windows. We consider the following two problems: (a) minimize the time by which all jobs are executed (traveling salesman problem) and (b) minimize the sum of the waiting times of the jobs (traveling repairman problem). We focus on the following two special cases: (a) The jobs are located on a line and (b) the number of nodes of the graph is bounded by some integer constant B. Furthermore, we consider in detail the special cases where (a) all of the processing times are 0, (b) all of the release times ri are 0, and (c) all of the deadlines di are infinite. For many of the resulting problem combinations, we settle their complexity either by establishing {NP}-completeness or by presenting polynomial (or pseudopolynomial) time algorithms.

    abstract = {We consider an online problem where a server operates on an edge-weighted graph G and an adversarial sequence of requests to vertices is released over time. Each request requires one unit of servicetime. The server is free to choose the ordering of service and intends to minimize the total flowtime of the requests. A natural class of algorithms for this problem are Ignore algorithms. From worst-case perspective we show that Ignore algorithms are not competitive for flowtime minimization. From an average-case point of view, we obtain a more detailed picture. In our model, the adversary may still choose the vertices of the requests arbitrarily. But the arrival times are according to a stochastic process (with some rate λ\&gt; 0), chosen by the adversary out of a natural class of processes. The class contains the Poisson-process and (some) deterministic arrivals as special cases. We then show that there is an Ignore algorithm that is competitive if and only if . Specifically, for , the expected competitive ratio of the algorithm is within a constant of the length of a shortest cycle that visits all vertices of G. The reason for this is that if  the requests either arrive slow enough for our algorithm or too fast even for an offline optimal algorithm. For λ= 1 the routing-mistakes of the online algorithm accumulate just as in the worst case. As an additional result, we show how Ignore tours are constructed optimally in polynomial time, if the underlying graph G is a line.},

The tests take advantage of the time window constraints to significantly reduce the state space and the number of state transitions. These reductions are performed both a priori and during the execution of the algorithm. The approach does not experience problems stemming from increasing problem size, wider or overlapping time windows, or an increasing number of states nearly as rapidly as other methods. Our computational results indicate that the algorithm was successful in solving problems with up to 200 nodes and fairly wide time windows. When the density of the nodes in the geographical region was kept constant as the problem size was increased, the algorithm was capable of solving problems with up to 800 nodes. For these problems, the {CPU} time increased linearly with problem size. These problem sizes are much larger than those of problems previously reported in the literature.},

This note presents a concise formulation of the time-constrained traveling salesman problem. The model assumes that the distances of the problem are symmetrical and that the triangle inequality holds. Additionally, the model allows the salesman to wait at a city, if necessary, for a time window to open. The dual of the formulation is shown to be a disjunctive graph model, which is well known from scheduling theory. A longest path algorithm is used to obtain bounding information for subproblems in a branch and bound solution procedure.

All of these problems are characterized by demands that arrive continuously and randomly throughout the day, and require a dispatcher to assign a driver to handle a specific demand. We use as our motivating application the load matching problem that arises in long-haul truckload trucking, where we have to assign drivers to loads on a real-time basis. A hybrid model is presented that handles the detailed assignment of drivers to loads, as well as handling forecasts of future loads. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our stochastic, dynamic model outperforms standard myopic models that are widely used in practice. 10.1287/trsc.30.3.195},

@incollection{Ausiello2000Salesmen,
    abstract = {The Traveling Salesman Problem ({TSP}) is a classical prob- lem in discrete optimization. Its paradigmatic character makes it one of the most studied in computer science and operations research and one for which an impressive amount of algorithms (in particular heuristics and approximation algorithms) have been proposed. While in the general case the problem is known not to allow any constant ratio approximation algorithm and in the metric case no better algorithm than Christofides' algorithm is known, which guarantees an approximation ratio of 3/2, re- cently an important breakthrough by Arora has led to the definition of a new polynomial approximation scheme for the Euclidean case. A grow- ing attention has also recently been posed on the approximation of other paradigmatic routing problems such as the Travelling Repairman Prob- lem ({TRP}). The altruistic Travelling Repairman seeks to minimimize the average time incurred by the customers to be served rather than to mini- mize its working time like the egoistic Travelling Salesman does. The new approximation scheme for the Travelling Salesman is also at the basis of a new approximation scheme for the Travelling Repairman problem in the euclidean space. New interesting constant approximation algorithms have recently been presented also for the Travelling Repairman on gen- eral metric spaces. Interesting applications of this line of research can be found in the problem of routing agents over the web. In fact the prob- lem of programming a  ” spider” for efficiently searching and reporting information is a clear example of potential applications of algorithms for the above mentioned problems. These problems are very close in spirit to the problem of searching an object in a known graph introduced by Koutsoupias, Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [14]. In this paper, moti- vated by web searching applications, we summarize the most important recent results concerning the approximate solution of the {TRP} and the {TSP} and their application and extension to web searching problems.},

The search ratio of a graph is the optimum competitive ratio (the worst-case ratio of the distance traveled before the unknown node is visited, over the distance between the node and a fixed root, minimized over all Hamiltonian walks of the graph). We also define the randomized search ratio (we minimize over all distributions of permutations). Finally, the traveling repairman problem seeks to minimize the expected time of visit to the unknown node, given some distribution on the nodes.

    abstract = {The Traveling Deliveryman Problem is a generalization of the Minimum Cost Hamiltonian Path Problem where the starting vertex of the path, i.e. a depot vertex, is fixed in advance and the cost associated with a Hamiltonian path equals the sum of the costs for the layers of paths (along the Hamiltonian path) going from the depot vertex to each of the remaining vertices. In this paper, we propose a new Integer Programming formulation for the problem and computationally evaluate the strength of its Linear Programming relaxation. Computational results are also presented for a cutting plane algorithm that uses a number of valid inequalities associated with the proposed formulation. Some of these inequalities are shown to be facet defining for the convex hull of feasible solutions to that formulation. These inequalities proved very effective when used to reinforce Linear Programming relaxation bounds, at the nodes of a Branch and Bound enumeration tree.},

@article{Maffioli1997Mixedinteger,
    abstract = {We present an exact approach for solving the Sequential Ordering Problem ({SOP}). In this problem, a set of jobs has to be processed on a single machine; a time window (deadline - release date) is associated with each job, and precedence relationships between jobs are given. Moreover, a setup time (possibly zero) before processing a job is assigned. The prob-lem consists in finding an ordering of the jobs such that the completion time of the job sequenced last is minimized. Starting from a 0-1 formulation of the problem, we translate the model into a linear Mixed Integer Program ({MIP}) problem by adding some variables representing the idle time of the machine, in such a way that both the subtour elimination constraints and the due forcing constraints are implicitly satisfied. Some computational experience is reported along with the analysis of a simple case study. The main goal of this work is to assess the suitability of the mathematical models presented with respect to avail-able {MIP} software like {OSL}.},

There exists a number of applications of the {DMP} in the fields of distribution and machine scheduling. The {DMP} is {NP}-hard. The objective of this paper is to develop new theoretical results and an exact algorithm for the problem. A new, integer linear programming formulation is provided, and results on the matroidal structure of a class of combinatorial problems are developed. These are used to derive lower bounds for the {DMP}. These bounds are embedded into an enumerative algorithm. The largest problems solved to optimality with the proposed algorithm involve 60 vertices. This compares favorably with previously published methods.},

The {TDTSP} can model several real world applications (e.g., one-machine sequencing). In this paper we present a classification of formulations for the {TDTSP}. This framework includes both new and old formulations. The new formulation presented in this paper is derived from a quadratic assignment model for the {TDTSP}. In a first step, Lawler's transformation procedure is used to derive an equivalent linearized version of the quadratic model. In a second step, a stronger formulation is obtained by tightening some constraints of the previous formulation. It is shown that, in terms of linear relaxations, the latter formulation is either equivalent or better than other formulations already known from the literature. Finally, we compare these formulations with other well known formulations for the classical traveling salesman problem.},

    abstract = {This paper describes a solution method for a multiple traveling salesman problem with time window constraints ({m-TSPTW}). The method was developed for local truckload pickup and delivery problems such as those supporting rail or maritime intermodal operations but is suitable for application in other problems in which the number of tasks assigned to each server at any time is relatively small. We present a model and describe an iterative solution technique in which explicit time constraints are replaced by binary flow variables. At each iteration two versions of the problem, one over-constrained and the other under-constrained are solved. The solution to the over-constrained problem provides a feasible solution, while the optimality gap provided by the two solutions informs the decision of whether to continue searching or to implement the best solution found so far. A specific time window partitioning scheme is used to ensure that the cost of solutions found are monotonically non-increasing. The method developed is suitable for real-time or quasi real-time implementation.},

@article{Stecco2009Tabu,
    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;This} paper introduces a tabu search heuristic for a production scheduling problem with sequence-dependent and time-dependent setup times on a single machine. The problem consists in scheduling a set of dependent jobs, where the transition between two jobs comprises an unrestricted setup that can be performed at any time, and a restricted setup that must be performed outside of a given time interval which repeats daily in the same position. The setup time between two jobs is thus a function of the completion time of the first job. The tabu search heuristic relies on shift and swap moves, and a surrogate objective function is used to speed-up the neighborhood evaluation. Computational experiments show that the proposed heuristic consistently finds better solutions in less computation time than a recent branch-and-cut algorithm. Furthermore, on instances where the branch-and-cut algorithm cannot find the optimal solution, the heuristic always identifies a better solution.},

@article{Albiach2008Asymmetric,

Unlike other existing papers about time-dependent routing problems, we focus on an exact method for solving this new problem. For this end we first transform the problem into an Asymmetric Generalized {TSP} and then into a Graphical Asymmetric {TSP}. In this way, we can apply a known exact algorithm for the Mixed General Routing Problem, which seems to run well with our resulting instances. Computational results are presented on a set of 270 adapted instances from benchmark {ATSPTW} instances.},

The {TSP}-{TWPC} is known to be {NP}-hard and has applications in many sequencing and distribution problems. In this paper we describe an exact algorithm to solve the problem that is based on dynamic programming and makes use of bounding functions to reduce the state space graph. These functions are obtained by means of a new technique that is a generalization of the "State Space Relaxation" for dynamic programming introduced by Christofides et al. (1981b).

The algorithm gradually builds a route by inserting at each step a vertex in its neighbourhood on the current route, and performing a local reoptimization. This is done while checking the feasibility of the remaining part of the route. Backtracking is sometimes necessary. Once a feasible route has been determined, an attempt is made to improve it by applying a post-optimization phase based on the successive removal and reinsertion of all vertices. Tests performed on 375 instances indicate that the proposed heuristic compares very well with alternative methods and very often produces optimal or near-optimal solutions.},

@incollection{Cirasella2001Asymmetric,

There are currently three general classes of such heuristics: classical tour construction heuristics such as Nearest Neighbor and the Greedy algorithm, local search algorithms based on re-arranging segments of the tour, as exemplified by the {Kanellakis-Papadimitriou} algorithm [{KP80}], and algorithms based on patching together the cycles in a minimum cycle cover, the best of which are variants on an algorithm proposed by Zhang [Zha93]. We test implementations of the main contenders from each class on a variety of instance types, introducing a variety of new random instance generators modeled on real-world applications of the {ATSP}. Among the many tentative conclusions we reach is that no single algorithm is dominant over all instance classes, although for each class the best tours are found either by Zhang's algorithm or an iterated variant on {Kanellakis-Papadimitriou}.},

@article{Ascheuer2000Polyhedral,
    abstract = {The asymmetric traveling salesman problem with time windows ({ATSP}-{TW}) is a basic model for scheduling and routing applications. In this paper, we present a formulation of the problem involving only 0/1 variables associated with the arcs of the underlying digraph. This has the advantage of avoiding additional variables as well as the associated (typically very ineffective) linking constraints. In the formulation, time-window restrictions are modeled using ldquoinfeasible path eliminationrdquo constraints. We present the basic form of these constraints along with some possible strengthenings. Several other classes of valid inequalities derived from related asymmetric traveling salesman problems are also described, along with a lifting theorem. We also study the {ATSP}-{TW} polytope, {PTW}, defined as the convex hull of the integer solutions of our model. We show that determining the dimension of {PTW} is a strongly \&{Nscr;\&Pscr};-complete problem, even if only one time window is present. In this latter case, we provide a minimal equation system for {PTW}. Computational experiments on the new formulation are reported in a companion paper, where we show that it outperforms alternative formulations on some classes of problem instances. {\copyright} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

@article{Hassin2001ZApproximations,
    abstract = {Approximation algorithms for  {NP} -hard optimization problems have been widely studied for over three decades. Most of these measure the quality of the solution produced by taking the ratio of the cost of the solution produced by the algorithm to the cost of an optimal solution. In certain cases, this ratio may not be very meaningful—for example, if the ratio of the worst solution to the best solution is at most some constant α, then an approximation algorithm with factor α may in fact yield the worst solution! To overcome this hurdle (among others), several authors have independently suggested the use of a different measure which we call  z -approximation. An algorithm is an α  z -approximation if it runs in polynomial time and produces a solution whose distance from the optimal one is at most α times the distance between the optimal solution and the worst possible solution. The results known so far about  z -approximations are either of the inapproximability type or rather straightforward observations. We design polynomial time algorithms for several fundamental discrete optimization problems; in particular we obtain a  z -approximation factor of    for the },

If ℓ satisfies the asymmetric triangle inequality, the problem is equivalent to that of finding an s-t path of minimum length that visits all the vertices. We refer to this problem as {ATSPP}. When s = t this is the well known asymmetric traveling salesman tour problem ({ATSP}). Although an O(logn) approximation ratio has long been known for {ATSP}, the best known ratio for {ATSPP} is . In this paper we present a polynomial time algorithm for {ATSPP} that has approximation ratio of O(logn). The algorithm generalizes to the problem of finding a minimum length path or cycle that is required to visit a subset of vertices in a given order.},

Transportation is carried out by vehicles providing a shared service. The problem consists of designing a set of minimum-cost vehicle routes satisfying capacity, duration, time window, pairing, precedence, and ride-time constraints. This paper introduces a mixed-integer programming formulation of the problem and a branch-and-cut algorithm. The algorithm uses new valid inequalities for the dial-a-ride problem as well as known valid inequalities for the traveling salesman, the vehicle routing, and the pick-up and delivery problems. Computational experiments performed on randomly generated instances show that the proposed approach can be used to solve small to medium-size instances. 10.1287/opre.1060.0283},

    abstract = {In the pickup and delivery problem with time windows ({PDPTW}), capacitated vehicles must be routed to satisfy a set of transportation requests between given origins and destinations. In addition to capacity and time window constraints, vehicle routes must also satisfy pairing and precedence constraints on pickups and deliveries. This paper introduces two new formulations for the {PDPTW} and the closely related dial-a-ride problem ({DARP}) in which a limit is imposed on the elapsed time between the pickup and the delivery of a request. Several families of valid inequalities are introduced to strengthen these two formulations. These inequalities are used within branch-and-cut algorithms which have been tested on several instance sets for both the {PDPTW} and the {DARP}. Instances with up to eight vehicles and 96 requests (194 nodes) have been solved to optimality. {\copyright} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. {NETWORKS}, Vol. 49(4), 258-272 2007},

@article{vanderBruggen1993VariableDepth,
    abstract = {We consider a single depot and a set of customers with known demands, each of which must be picked up and delivered at specified locations and within given time windows. We seek a route and a schedule for a single vehicle with known capacity, which minimizes the route duration, i.e., the difference between the arrival time and the departure time at the depot. We develop a local search method for this problem based on a variable-depth search, similar to the {Lin-Kernighan} algorithm for the traveling salesman problem. The method consists of two phases. In the first phase, a feasible route is constructed; in the second phase, it is iteratively improved. In both phases, we use a variable-depth search built up out of seven basic types of arc-exchange procedures. When tested on real-life problems, the method is shown to produce near-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of computation time. In spite of this, there is the theoretical possibility that the method may end up with a poor or even infeasible solution. As a safeguard against such an emergency, we have developed an alternative algorithm based on simulated annealing. As a rule, it finds high quality solutions in a relatively large computation time. 10.1287/trsc.27.3.298},

Hence, the central planner in each day needs to decide whether to transfer any cars from one city to the other. We develop a two-stage dynamic programming model, in which we determine the vehicle transfer policy in the second stage and the optimal fleet size in the first stage. Although the objective function could be neither concave nor quasi-concave due to lost sales, we can find the optimal fleet size and vehicle transfer policy by solving a series of linear programming problems. We propose a heuristic solution, which is based on a special case analysis, for the fleet size problem. A numerical study reveals that our heuristic solution for the fleet size performs well. However, if the corresponding vehicle transfer policy is not appropriate, the overall performance can drastically deteriorate even with the optimal fleet size. Several extensions of our basic model are also analyzed.},

@article{Song2008Optimal,
    abstract = {This article considers the empty vehicle redistribution problem in a hub-and-spoke transportation system, with random demands and stochastic transportation times. An event-driven model is formulated, which yields the implicit optimal control policy. Based on the analytical results for two-depot systems, a dynamic decomposition procedure is presented which produces a near-optimal policy with linear computational complexity in terms of the number of spokes. The resulting policy has the same asymptotic behavior as that of the optimal policy. It is found that the threshold-type control policy is not usually optimal in such systems. The results are illustrated through small-scale numerical examples. Through simulation the robustness of the dynamic decomposition policy is tested using a variety of scenarios: more spokes, more vehicles, different combinations of distribution types for the empty vehicle travel times and loaded vehicle arrivals. This shows that the dynamic decomposition policy is significantly better than a heuristics policy in all scenarios and appears to be robust to the assumptions of the distribution types. {\copyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

@article{vanderHeijden2002Scheduling,
    abstract = {Abstract.\&nbsp;\&nbsp; One of the major planning issues in large scale automated transportation systems is so-called empty vehicle management, the timely supply of vehicles to terminals in order to reduce cargo waiting times. Motivated by a Dutch pilot project on an underground cargo transportation system using Automated Guided Vehicles ({AGVs}), we developed several rules and algorithms for empty vehicle management, varying from trivial {First-Come}, {First-Served} ({FCFS}) via look-ahead rules to integral planning. For our application, we focus on attaining customer service levels in the presence of varying order priorities, taking into account resource capacities and the relation to other planning decisions, such as terminal management. We show how the various rules are embedded in a framework for logistics control of automated transportation networks. Using simulation, the planning options are evaluated on their performance in terms of customer service levels, {AGV} requirements and empty travel distances. Based on our experiments, we conclude that look-ahead rules have significant advantages above {FCFS}. A more advanced so-called serial scheduling method outperforms the look-ahead rules if the peak demand quickly moves amongst routes in the system.},

@article{Jemai2008NeuralTabu,
    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;The} Real Time Vehicle Routing Problem {RTVRP} is a dynamic routing problem where requests are generated dynamically during the operation horizon without any previous knowledge. Received requests need to be answered as fast as possible and then assigned to a vehicle to be served. Due to timing constraints of the {RTVRP}, a solving approach should give the best compromise between the cost of the provided solution and the computation time needed to find it. In this paper, we present a neural-tabu search solving scheme for the {RTVRP}. The developed approach is composed by two phases; The first part consists of learning and reproducing previous routing decisions using a feed forward neural network with a particular structure. The second phase is based on a tabu search heuristic that takes its initial solution from the assignment provided by the neural module. If the reaction time is still available, the tabu search module will continue ameliorating the final solution. To evaluate the proposed approach a set of problems are simulated and solved. The obtained results are compared to those given by the First Come First Served {FCFS} and Nearest Neighbor {NN} policies and also to the optimal solutions provided by the {GNU} Linear Programming Kit {GLPK}.},

Such a problem arises in situations with large demand or tight deadlines so that routes that satisfy all demand points are difficult or impossible to obtain. An important application is the distribution of medical supplies to respond to large-scale emergencies, such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks. We present a chance constrained formulation of the problem that is equivalent to a deterministic problem with modified demand and travel time parameters under mild assumptions on the distribution of stochastic parameters and relate it to a robust optimization approach. A tabu heuristic is proposed to solve this {MIP} and simulations are conducted to evaluate the quality of routes generated from both deterministic and chance constrained formulations.

@proceedings{Waisanen2006Minimal,
    abstract = {We consider a network in which a set of vehicles is responsible for picking up and delivering messages that arrive according to Poisson process with pickup and delivery location distributed in certain region uniformly at random. The vehicles are required to pickup and deliver the messages so that the average delay is minimized. In our previous work, we examined the benefits of vehicle control on the message delay. Specifically, we obtained optimal delay scaling where each message was required to be picked up and delivered by the same vehicle. Motivated by application to wireless networks, in this paper we remove this restriction and allow the vehicles to relay message between them. Specifically, we consider two relay methods. The first requires vehicles to relay messages directly to each other using a synchronous rendezvous schedule while the other utilizes an infinite capacity depot to store relayed messages. Under both relay models, we characterize the minimal delay scaling which demonstrates that relaying helps in reducing delay further. Surprisingly, the optimal delay scaling is achieved with only one relay per message. We note that our results naturally apply to the classical vehicle routing setup as well as to a wireless communication network. Specifically, our results suggest that the delay reduction can be very significant in a controlled relay network},

In reverse logistics, the customers who have both a pick-up and a delivery demand are serviced with a single stop.

Commodities to be distributed are loaded at the depot and delivered to the customers. The empty packages are collected from the customers and transported back to the depot.

After a simple description of the problem, the vehicle routing problems in reverse logistics is investigated, a mathematic model of the problem is built. Then, a genetic algorithm to the problem is suggested. In this algorithm, the ranking replacement method is used, and the population is partitioned into four subsets with respect to the fitness and unfitness of the offspring. Finally, the proposed genetic algorithm is successfully applied to some problems, and the superiority of the genetic algorithm is proved through the comparison of the genetic algorithms with a heuristic algorithm.},

@article{Marinakis2007Annotated,
    abstract = {One of the most significant problems of supply chain management is the distribution of products between locations, most known as the Vehicle Routing Problem ({VRP}). The vehicle routing problem is one of the most challenging problems in the field of combinatorial optimization. Dantzig and Ramser first introduced the {VRP} in 1959. They proposed the first mathematical programming formulation. In 1964 Clarke and Wright proposed an effective greedy heuristic that improved Dantzig and Ramser approach. Since then, hundreds of models and algorithms were proposed for the optimal and approximate solution of the different versions of the {VRP}. In this paper, we present an annotated bibliography of the vehicle routing problem and its variant.},

We assume that such communication capability exists for a single pickup and delivery vehicle and that we know the likelihood, as a function of time, that each of the vehicle's potential customers will make a pickup request. We then model and analyze the problem of constructing a minimum expected total cost route from an origin to a destination that anticipates and then responds to service requests, if they occur, while the vehicle is en route. We model this problem as a Markov decision process and present several structured results associated with the optimal expected cost-to-go function and an optimal policy for route construction. We illustrate the behavior of an optimal policy with several numerical examples and demonstrate the superiority of an optimal anticipatory policy, relative to a route design approach that reflects the reactive nature of current routing procedures for less-than-truckload pickup and delivery.},

    abstract = {This paper presents a hybrid adaptive predictive control approach that includes future information in real-time routing decisions in the context of a dynamic pickup and delivery problem ({DPDP}). We recognize in this research that when the problem is dynamic, an additional stochastic effect has to be considered within the analytical expression of the objective function for vehicle scheduling and routing, which is the extra cost associated with potential rerouting arising from unknown requests in the future. The major contributions of this paper are: first, the development of a formal adaptive predictive control framework to model the {DPDP}, and second, the development and coding of an ad hoc particle swarm optimization ({PSO}) algorithm to efficiently solve it. Predictive state-space formulations are written on the relevant variables (vehicle load and departure time at stops) for the {DPDP}. Next, an objective function is stated to solve the real-time system when predicting one and two steps ahead in time. A problem-specific {PSO} algorithm is proposed and coded according to the dynamic formulation. Then, the {PSO} method is used to validate this approach through a simulated numerical example. 10.1287/trsc.1080.0251},

@article{Spivey2004Dynamic,

In this paper, we address the simpler dynamic assignment problem, where a resource (container, vehicle, or driver) can serve only one task at a time. We propose a very general class of dynamic assignment models, and propose an adaptive, nonmyopic algorithm that involves iteratively solving sequences of assignment problems no larger than what would be required of a myopic model. We consider problems where the attribute space of future resources and tasks is small enough to be enumerated, and propose a hierarchical aggregation strategy for problems where the attribute spaces are too large to be enumerated. Finally, we use the formulation to also test the value of advance information, which offers a more realistic estimate over studies that use purely myopic models. 10.1287/trsc.1030.0073},

Small instances of the {IDARP} can be solved using an exact solution method, and one such instance is studied.

Phase one consists of an iterated variable neighborhood search-based heuristic, generating approximate weighted sum solutions; phase two is a path relinking module, computing additional efficient solutions. Results for two sets of benchmark instances are reported. For the smaller instances, exact efficient sets are generated by means of the \&epsi;-constraint method.

Each customer must be visited exactly once by the vehicle serving the demands while minimising the total travel distance. It is assumed that any unit of product collected from a pickup customer can be delivered to any delivery customer. This problem is called one-commodity pickup-and-delivery {TSP} ({1-PDTSP}). We propose two heuristic approaches for the problem: (1) is based on a greedy algorithm and improved with a k-optimality criterion and (2) is based on a branch-and-cut procedure for finding an optimal local solution. The proposal can easily be used to solve the classical "{TSP} with pickup-and-delivery," a version studied in literature and involving two commodities.

This problem occurs as the last step or as a sub-problem in many common approaches to solving routing and scheduling problems. We show that the complexity of the algorithm, expressed as a number of unidimensional minimizations, is on the order of the number of nodes for convex inconvenience functions. For linear and quadratic functions, this complexity is linear in the number of nodes. We present extensions to the case where linear costs are applied to waiting time, and also to the case where the service time variables are discrete. 10.1287/trsc.24.2.145},

@article{Miller1960Integer,
    abstract = {It has been observed by many people that a striking number of quite diverse mathematical problems can be formulated as problems in integer programming, that is, linear programming problems in which some or all of the variables are required to assume integral values. This fact is rendered quite interesting by recent research on such problems, notably by R. E. Gomory [2, 3], which gives promise of yielding efficient computational techniques for their solution. The present paper provides yet another example of the versatility of integer programming as a mathematical modeling device by representing a generalization of the well-known  ” Travelling Salesman Problem” in integer programming terms. The authors have developed several such models, of which the one presented here is the most efficient in terms of generality, number of variables, and number of constraints. This model is due to the second author [4] and was presented briefly at the Symposium on Combinatorial Problems held at Princeton University, April 1960, sponsored by {SIAM} and {IBM}. The problem treated is: (1) A salesman is required to visit each of n cities, indexed by 1, ··· , n. He leaves from a  ” base city” indexed by 0, visits each of the n other cities exactly once, and returns to city 0. During his travels he must return to 0 exactly t times, including his final return (here t may be allowed to vary), and he must visit no more than p cities in one tour. (By a tour we mean a succession of visits to cities without stopping at city 0.) It is required to find such an itinerary which minimizes the total distance traveled by the {salesman.Note} that if t is fixed, then for the problem to have a solution we must have tp \&{gE}; n. For t = 1, p \&{gE}; n, we have the standard traveling salesman {problem.Let} dij (i ≠ j = 0, 1, ··· , n) be the distance covered in traveling from city i to city j. The following integer programming problem will be shown to be equivalent to (1): (2) Minimize the linear form ∑{0\&lE};{i≠j\&lE};n∑ dijxij over the set determined by the relations ∑ni=0i≠jxij = 1 (j = 1, ··· , n) ∑nj=0j≠ixij = 1 (i = 1, ··· , n) ui - uj + pxij \&{lE}; p - 1 (1 \&{lE}; i ≠ j \&{lE}; n) where the xij are non-negative integers and the ui (i = 1, …, n) are arbitrary real numbers. (We shall see that it is permissible to restrict the ui to be non-negative integers as {well.)If} t is fixed it is necessary to add the additional relation: ∑nu=1xi0 = t Note that the constraints require that xij = 0 or 1, so that a natural correspondence between these two problems exists if the xij are interpreted as follows: The salesman proceeds from city i to city j if and only if xij = 1. Under this correspondence the form to be minimized in (2) is the total distance to be traveled by the salesman in (1), so the burden of proof is to show that the two feasible sets correspond; i.e., a feasible solution to (2) has xij which do define a legitimate itinerary in (1), and, conversely a legitimate itinerary in (1) defines xij, which, together with appropriate ui, satisfy the constraints of ({2).Consider} a feasible solution to ({2).The} number of returns to city 0 is given by ∑ni=1xi0. The constraints of the form ∑ xij = 1, all xij non-negative integers, represent the conditions that each city (other than zero) is visited exactly once. The ui play a role similar to node potentials in a network and the inequalities involving them serve to eliminate tours that do not begin and end at city 0 and tours that visit more than p cities. Consider any xr0r1 = 1 (r1 ≠ 0). There exists a unique r2 such that xr1r2 = 1. Unless r2 = 0, there is a unique r3 with xr2r3 = 1. We proceed in this fashion until some rj = 0. This must happen since the alternative is that at some point we reach an rk = rj, j + 1 < k. Since none of the r's are zero we have uri - uri + 1 + pxriri + 1 \&{lE}; p - 1 or uri - uri + 1 \&{lE}; - 1. Summing from i = j to k - 1, we have urj - urk = 0 \&{lE}; j + 1 - k, which is a contradiction. Thus all tours include city 0. It remains to observe that no tours is of length greater than p. Suppose such a tour exists, x0r1 , xr1r2 , ·\&middot· , xrprp+1 = 1 with all ri ≠ 0. Then, as before, ur1 - urp+1 \&{lE}; - p or urp+1 - ur1 \&{gE}; {p.But} we have urp+1 - ur1 + pxrp+1r1 \&{lE}; p - 1 or urp+1 - ur1 \&{lE}; p (1 - xrp+1r1) - 1 \&{lE}; p - 1, which is a {contradiction.Conversely}, if the xij correspond to a legitimate itinerary, it is clear that the ui can be adjusted so that ui = j if city i is the jth city visited in the tour which includes city i, for we then have ui - uj = - 1 if xij = 1, and always ui - uj \&{lE}; p - {1.The} above integer program involves n2 + n constraints (if t is not fixed) in n2 + 2n variables. Since the inequality form of constraint is fundamental for integer programming calculations, one may eliminate 2n variables, say the xi0 and x0j, by means of the equation constraints and produce an equivalent problem with n2 + n inequalities and n2 {variables.The} currently known integer programming procedures are sufficiently regular in their behavior to cast doubt on the heuristic value of machine experiments with our model. However, it seems appropriate to report the results of the five machine experiments we have conducted so far. The solution procedure used was the all-integer algorithm of R. E. Gomory [3] without the ranking procedure he {describes.The} first three experiments were simple model verification tests on a four-city standard traveling salesman problem with distance matrix [ 20 23 4 30 7 27 25 5 25 3 21 26 ]The first experiment was with a model, now obsolete, using roughly twice as many constraints and variables as the current model (for this problem, 28 constraints in 21 variables). The machine was halted after 4000 pivot steps had failed to produce a {solution.The} second experiment used the earlier model with the xi0 and x0j eliminated, resulting in a 28-constraint, 15-variable problem. Here the machine produced the optimal solution in 41 pivot {steps.The} third experiment used the current formulation with the xi0 and x0j eliminated, yielding 13 constraints and 9 variables. The optimal solution was reached in 7 pivot {steps.The} fourth and fifth experiments were used on a standard ten-city problem, due to Barachet, solved by Dantzig, Johnson and Fulkerson [1]. The current formulation was used, yielding 91 constraints in 81 variables. The fifth problem differed from the fourth only in that the ordering of the rows was altered to attempt to introduce more favorable pivot choices. In each case the machine was stopped after over 250 pivot steps had failed to produce the solution. In each case the last 100 pivot steps had failed to change the value of the objective {function.It} seems hopeful that more efficient integer programming procedures now under development will yield a satisfactory algorithmic solution to the traveling salesman problem, when applied to this model. In any case, the model serves to illustrate how problems of this sort may be succinctly formulated in integer programming terms.},

@article{Fu2006Heuristic,
    abstract = {There are a number of transportation applications that require the use of a heuristic shortest path algorithm rather than one of the standard, optimal algorithms. This is primarily due to the requirements of some transportation applications where shortest paths need to be quickly identified either because an immediate response is required (e.g., in-vehicle route guidance systems) or because the shortest paths need to be recalculated repeatedly (e.g., vehicle routing and scheduling). For this reason a number of heuristic approaches have been advocated for decreasing the computation time of the shortest path algorithm. This paper presents a survey review of various heuristic shortest path algorithms that have been developed in the past. The goal is to identify the main features of different heuristic strategies, develop a unifying classification framework, and summarize relevant computational experience.},

@article{Larsen2004Priori,
    abstract = {In this paper we examine the traveling saleman problem with time windows for various degrees of dynamism. In contrast to the static problem, where the dispatcher can plan ahead, in the dynamic version, part or all of the necessary information becomes available only during the day of operation. We seek to minimize lateness and examine the impact of this criterion choice on the distance traveled. Our focus on lateness is motivated by the problem faced by overnight mail service providers. We propose a real-time solution method that requires the vehicle, when idle, to wait at the current customer location until it can service another customer without being early. In addition, we develop several enhanced versions of this method that may reposition the vehicle at a location different from that of the current customer based on a priori information on future requests. The results we obtained on both randomly generated data and on a real-world case study indicate that all policies proved capable of significantly reducing lateness. Our results also show that this can be accomplished with only small distance increases. The basic policy outperformed the other methods primarily when lateness and distance were equally minimized and proved very robust in all environments studied. When only lateness was considered, the policy to reposition the vehicle at a location near the current customer generally provided the largest reductions in average lateness and the number of late customers. It also produced the least extra distance to be traveled among the relocation policies.},

These restricted neighborhoods are calledgranular, and may be seen as an efficient implementation of candidate-list strategies proposed for tabu-search algorithms.

@article{Yang1999OnLine,
    abstract = {With greater availability of real-time information systems, algorithms are needed to support commercial fleet operators in their decisions to assign vehicles and drivers to loads in a dynamic environment. A rolling horizon framework for the dynamic assignment and sequencing of trucks to jobs consisting of picking up and delivering full truckloads when requests for service arise on a continuous basis is presented. A mathematical formulation of the problem faced at each stage is presented; its solution allows for the dynamic reassignment of trucks to loads, including diversion to a new load of a truck already en route to pick up another load, as well as for the dynamic resequencing of the order in which loads are to be served as new loads arrive and conditions unfold. Loads have associated time windows for pickup and delivery, and the objective function includes an explicit penalty cost for not serving a particular load. A solution algorithm is presented and implemented, and computational results are presented, yielding insight into various operational trade-offs in dynamic fleet operations. Because applicability of the solution algorithm is limited to relatively small problems, and given the stochastic dynamic nature of these systems, numerical experiments are performed to compare the quality of the solution obtained using this approach with the performance of simpler and less computationally demanding local rules.},

@article{Waisanen2008Dynamic,
    abstract = {This paper considers a network in which a set of vehicles is responsible for picking up and delivering messages that arrive according to a Poisson process. Message pickup and delivery locations are uniformly distributed in a convex region. The vehicles are required to pickup and deliver the messages so that the average delay is minimized. It is required that the vehicle that picks up a message must be the one to deliver it. This problem is called the dynamic pickup and delivery problem ({DPDP}) and has applications in the context of autonomous vehicles and wireless ad hoc networks. The control policies considered are separable into two parts: an assignment policy used by a centralized controller to assign arriving messages to the vehicles for service and a service policy used by each vehicle to determine the service routes through its assigned messages. Lower bounds are provided on the delay achievable by separable control policies that depend on the information constraints in place. It is proved that the optimal average delay scaling can be reduced when message destination information is available to the centralized controller in addition to the message source information. The paper also provides policies that achieve these scaling bounds, proving that these bounds are tight.},

For the case of a single dynamic customer, we completely characterize the optimal policy.

@article{Cortes2008Hybrid,
    abstract = {This paper presents a hybrid adaptive predictive control approach to incorporate future information regarding unknown demand and expected traffic conditions, in the context of a dynamic pickup and delivery problem with fixed fleet size. As the routing problem is dynamic, several stochastic effects have to be considered within the analytical expression of the dispatcher assignment decision objective function. This paper is focused on two issues: one is the extra cost associated with potential rerouting arising from unknown requests in the future, and the other is the potential uncertainty in travel time coming from non-recurrent traffic congestion from unexpected {incidents.These} effects are incorporated explicitly in the objective function of the hybrid predictive controller. In fact, the proposed predictive control strategy is based on a multivariable model that includes both discrete/integer and continuous variables. The vehicle load and the sequence of stops correspond to the discrete/integer variable, adding the vehicle position as an indicator of the traffic congestion conditions. The strategy is analyzed under two scenarios. The first one considers a predictable congestion obtained using historical data (off-line method) requiring a predictive model of velocities distributed over zones. The second scenario that accepts unpredictable congestion events generates a more complex problem that is managed by using both fault detection and isolation and fuzzy fault-tolerant control approaches. Results validating these approaches are presented through a simulated numerical example. Copyright {\copyright} 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this study, the strategies are tested in a constructive-deconstructive heuristic for the dynamic pickup and delivery problem with hard time windows and random travel times. Comparisons of the solution quality provided by these strategies to a more conventional approach were performed on randomly generated instances up to 100 requests with static and dynamic (time-dependent) travel times and different degrees of dynamism. The results indicate the advantages of the strategies both in terms of lost requests and number of vehicles.},

The problem statement and initialization of the development project was made by the Copenhagen {Fire-Fighting} Service ({CFFS}). The {CFFS} needed a new system for scheduling elderly and disabled persons, involving about 50.000 requests per year. The problem is characterized by, among other things, multiple capacities and multiple objectives. The capacities refer to the fact that a vehicle may be equipped with e.g. normal seats, children seats or wheel chair places. The objectives relate to a number of concerns such as e.g. short driving time, high vehicle utilization or low costs. A solution algorithm {REBUS} based on an insertion heuristics was developed. The algorithm permits in a flexible way weighting of the various goals such that the solution reflects the user's preferences. The algorithm is implemented in a dynamic environment intended for on-line scheduling. Thus, a new request for service is treated in less than 1 second, permitting an interactive user interface.},

@article{Lipmann2004OnLine,

Each ride is characterized by two points in the metric space, a source, the starting point of the ride, and a destination, the endpoint of the ride. Usually it is assumed that at the release of a request, complete information about the ride is known. We diverge from this by assuming that at the release of a ride, only information about the source is given. At visiting the source, the information about the destination will be made available to the servers. For many practical problems, our model is closer to reality. However, we feel that the lack of information is often a choice, rather than inherent to the problem: additional information can be obtained, but this requires investments in information systems. In this paper we give mathematical evidence that for the problem under study it pays to invest.},

    abstract = {We consider online versions of the traveling salesman problem ({TSP}) and traveling repairman problem ({TRP}) where instances are not known in advance. Cities (points) to be visited are revealed over time, while the server is en route serving previously released requests. These problems are known in the literature as the online {TSP} ({TRP}, respectively). The corresponding offline problems are the {TSP} ({TRP}) with release dates, problems where each point has to be visited at or after a given release date. In the current literature, the assumption is that a request becomes known at the time of its release date. In this paper we introduce the notion of a requests  disclosure date , the time when a citys location and release date are revealed to the server. In a variety of disclosure date scenarios and metric spaces, we give new online algorithms and quantify the value of this advanced information in the form of improved competitive ratios. We also provide a general result on polynomial-time online algorithms for the online {TSP}.},

    abstract = {In the traveling repairman problem ({TRP}), a tour must be found through every one of a set of points (cities) in some metric space such that the weighted sum of completion times of the cities is minimized. Given a tour, the completion time of a city is the time traveled on the tour before the city is reached. In the online traveling repairman problem {OLTRP} requests for visits to cities arrive online while the repairman is traveling. We analyze the performance of algorithms for the online problem using competitive analysis, where the cost of an online algorithm is compared to that of an optimal offline algorithm. Feuerstein and Stougie [8] present a 9-competitive algorithm for the {OLTRP} on the real line. In this paper we show how to use techniques from online-scheduling to obtain a 6-competitive deterministic algorithm for the {OLTRP} on any metric space. We also present a randomized algorithm with competitive ratio of 3/ln 2 \&lt; 4.3281 against an oblivious adversary. Our results extend to the  ” dial-a-ride” generalization {L-OLDARP} of the {OLTRP}, where objects have to be picked up and delivered by a server. We supplement the deterministic lower bounds presented in [8] with lower bounds on the competitive ratio of any randomized algorithm against an oblivious adversary. Our lower bounds are ln 16+1/ln 16-1 \&gt; 2.1282 for the {L-OLDARP} on the line, 4e-5/2e-3 \&gt; 2.41041 for the {L-OlDarp} on general metric spaces, 2 for the {OLTRP} on the line, and 7/3 for the {OLTRP} on general metric spaces.},

    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;This} study analyzes and solves a patient transportation problem arising in large hospitals. The aim is to provide an efficient and timely transport service to patients between several locations in a hospital campus. Transportation requests arrive in a dynamic fashion and the solution methodology must therefore be capable of quickly inserting new requests in the current vehicle routes. Contrary to standard dial-a-ride problems, the problem under study includes several complicating constraints which are specific to a hospital context. The study provides a detailed description of the problem and proposes a two-phase heuristic procedure capable of handling its many features. In the first phase a simple insertion scheme is used to generate a feasible solution, which is improved in the second phase with a tabu search algorithm. The heuristic procedure was extensively tested on real data provided by a German hospital. Results show that the algorithm is capable of handling the dynamic aspect of the problem and of providing high-quality solutions. In particular, it succeeded in reducing waiting times for patients while using fewer vehicles.},

@article{Yang2004RealTime,
    abstract = {In this paper we formally introduce a generic real-time multivehicle truckload pickup and delivery problem. The problem includes the consideration of various costs associated with trucks' empty travel distances, jobs' delayed completion times, and job rejections. Although very simple, the problem captures most features of the operational problem of a real-world trucking fleet that dynamically moves truckloads between different sites according to customer requests that arrive continuously.  We propose a mixed-integer programming formulation for the offline version of the problem. We then consider and compare five rolling horizon strategies for the real-time version. Two of the policies are based on a repeated reoptimization of various instances of the offline problem, while the others use simpler local (heuristic) rules. One of the reoptimization strategies is new, while the other strategies have recently been tested for similar real-time fleet management problems.  The comparison of the policies is done under a general simulation framework. The analysis is systematic and considers varying traffic intensities, varying degrees of advance information, and varying degrees of flexibility for job-rejection decisions. The new reoptimization policy is shown to systematically outperform the others under all these conditions. 10.1287/trsc.1030.0068},

The standard solution methodology for the dynamic {PDPTW} is the use of a rolling time horizon as proposed by Psaraftis. When assigning a new request to a vehicle it may be preferable to consider the impact of a decision both on a short-term and on a long-term horizon. In particular, better managing slack time in the distant future may help reduce routing cost. This paper describes double-horizon based heuristics for the dynamic {PDPTW}.

In a first stage, decisions regarding depot location, fleet size and planned routes have to be made without knowing the actual supplies, so that the total supply of a route may turn out to exceed the vehicle capacity (i.e. failures may occur). In such an event, a corrective recourse action is taken at a second stage: the vehicle returns to the depot and empties its load before resuming its journey. Such an action generates a penalty. In this paper, two variants are studies: (P1) minimize first stage costs so that the probability of route failure does not exceed a preset threshold; (P2) minimize first stage costs so that the expected penalty of any route does not exceed a fraction of its planned cost. The problems are modelled as integer linear programs and solved to optimality.},

In this problem, lateness at customer locations is allowed although a penalty is incurred and added to the objective value. By adding large penalty values, the vehicle routing problem with hard time windows can be addressed as well. In the tabu search, a neighborhood of the current solution is created through an exchange procedure that swaps sequences of consecutive customers (or segments) between two routes. The tabu search also exploits an adaptive memory that contains the routes of the best previously visited solutions. New starting points for the tabu search are produced through a combination of routes taken from different solutions found in this memory. Many best-known solutions are reported on classical test problems. 10.1287/trsc.31.2.170},

@article{Hanshar2007Dynamic,
    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Many} difficult combinatorial optimization problems have been modeled as static problems. However, in practice, many problems are dynamic and changing, while some decisions have to be made before all the design data are known. For example, in the Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem ({DVRP}), new customer orders appear over time, and new routes must be reconfigured while executing the current solution. Montemanni et al. [1] considered a {DVRP} as an extension to the standard vehicle routing problem ({VRP}) by decomposing a {DVRP} as a sequence of static {VRPs}, and then solving them with an ant colony system ({ACS}) algorithm. This paper presents a genetic algorithm ({GA}) methodology for providing solutions for the {DVRP} model employed in [1]. The effectiveness of the proposed {GA} is evaluated using a set of benchmarks found in the literature. Compared with a tabu search approach implemented herein and the aforementioned {ACS}, the proposed {GA} methodology performs better in minimizing travel costs.},

@article{Branke2005Waiting,
    abstract = {Many real-world vehicle routing problems are dynamic optimization problems, with customer requests arriving over time, requiring a repeated reoptimization. In this paper, we consider a dynamic vehicle routing problem where one additional customer arrives at a beforehand unknown location when the vehicles are already under way. Our objective is to maximize the probability that the additional customer can be integrated into one of the otherwise fixed tours without violating time constraints. This is achieved by letting the vehicles wait at suitable locations during their tours, thus influencing the position of the vehicles at the time when the new customer arrives. For the cases of one and two vehicles, we derive theoretical results about the best waiting strategies. The general problem is shown to be {NP}-complete. Several deterministic waiting strategies and an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the waiting strategy are proposed and compared empirically. It is demonstrated that a proper waiting strategy can significantly increase the probability of being able to service the additional customer, at the same time reducing the average detour to serve that customer. 10.1287/trsc.1040.0095},

@article{Pisinger2007General,
    abstract = {We present a unified heuristic which is able to solve five different variants of the vehicle routing problem: the vehicle routing problem with time windows ({VRPTW}), the capacitated vehicle routing problem ({CVRP}), the multi-depot vehicle routing problem ({MDVRP}), the site-dependent vehicle routing problem ({SDVRP}) and the open vehicle routing problem ({OVRP}). All problem variants are transformed into a rich pickup and delivery model and solved using the adaptive large neighborhood search ({ALNS}) framework presented in Ropke and Pisinger [An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows. Transportation Science, to appear]. The {ALNS} framework is an extension of the large neighborhood search framework by Shaw [Using constraint programming and local search methods to solve vehicle routing problems. In: {CP}-98, Fourth international conference on principles and practice of constraint programming, Lecture notes in computer science, vol. 1520, 1998. p. 417–31] with an adaptive layer. This layer adaptively chooses among a number of insertion and removal heuristics to intensify and diversify the search. The presented approach has a number of advantages: it provides solutions of very high quality, the algorithm is robust, and to some extent self-calibrating. Moreover, the unified model allows the dispatcher to mix various variants of {VRP} problems for individual customers or vehicles. As we believe that the {ALNS} framework can be applied to a large number of tightly constrained optimization problems, a general description of the framework is given, and it is discussed how the various components can be designed in a particular setting. The paper is concluded with a computational study, in which the five different variants of the vehicle routing problem are considered on standard benchmark tests from the literature. The outcome of the tests is promising as the algorithm is able to improve 183 best known solutions out of 486 benchmark tests. The heuristic has also shown promising results for a large class of vehicle routing problems with backhauls as demonstrated in Ropke and Pisinger [A unified heuristic for a large class of vehicle routing problems with backhauls.

@article{Ropke2006Adaptive,
    abstract = {The pickup and delivery problem with time windows is the problem of serving a number of transportation requests using a limited amount of vehicles. Each request involves moving a number of goods from a pickup location to a delivery location. Our task is to construct routes that visit all locations such that corresponding pickups and deliveries are placed on the same route, and such that a pickup is performed before the corresponding delivery. The routes must also satisfy time window and capacity constraints.  This paper presents a heuristic for the problem based on an extension of the large neighborhood search heuristic previously suggested for solving the vehicle routing problem with time windows. The proposed heuristic is composed of a number of competing subheuristics that are used with a frequency corresponding to their historic performance. This general framework is denoted adaptive large neighborhood search.  The heuristic is tested on more than 350 benchmark instances with up to 500 requests. It is able to improve the best known solutions from the literature for more than 50\% of the problems.  The computational experiments indicate that it is advantageous to use several competing subheuristics instead of just one. We believe that the proposed heuristic is very robust and is able to adapt to various instance characteristics. 10.1287/trsc.1050.0135},

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, which has improved 10 (17\%) of the 56 best published solutions to the Solomon benchmarks, while matching or improving the best solutions in 46 problems (82\%). More important perhaps, the algorithm is shown to be very robust. With a fixed configuration of its parameters, it returns either the best published solutions (or improvements thereof) or solutions very close in quality on all Solomon benchmarks. Very preliminary results on the extended Solomon benchmarks are also given. 10.1287/trsc.1030.0049},

The approach was evaluated on vehicle routing problems adapted from the Solomon benchmarks with a degree of dynamism varying between 30\% and 80\%.

@inproceedings{Bly2005Three,
    abstract = {The principles of public transport are the same today as in the stagecoach era. Vehicles operate according to a published schedule, passengers go to a designated stop and wait for the vehicle to arrive. Their journey is interrupted by periodic stops as the vehicle picks up or drops off passengers. If the passenger is lucky the service will have a stop near the desired destination. If not, it will be necessary to transfer to another service or services. The waiting and interchange components of the journey are generally regarded as inconvenient (and, in generalised cost terms, costly). A Personal Rapid Transit ({PRT}) system uses automatically-driven small vehicles to carry individuals or small groups non-stop from the origin station to the destination station, wherever the stations lie on the network of guideways. Because vehicles can be parked off-line at stations to be immediately available when passengers arrive, or if no vehicle is at the station one can be called up automatically from nearby, waiting times are very short or zero, and since all stations are off-line there are no intermediate stops. Several such systems reached advanced stages of design and development in the {UK}, Europe and the {USA} in the early 1970s, but none were put into public operation, though a larger vehicle derivative still operates as a small automated tram to serve a university campus in Morgantown, Virginia, {USA}. The 1970s proposals were too advanced for the available technology. Such systems could have been made operable, but they were too complex and expensive, and the guideway and infrastructure tended to be large and too visually intrusive to be aesthetically acceptable. Thirty years later, technology has moved on. Control systems which required a room of mainframe computer then can now be run from a laptop. Proposals for {PRT} are back. The particular system described here has been developed by Advanced Transport Systems Ltd of Bristol. Development of the prototype test track and vehicles was funded in part by the Department for Transport, and the assessments of the {PRT} system described here were made for {DfT} and for the European Commission as part of the {EDICT} project.},

Our system first uses the content and hyperlink structure of Wikipedia articles to identify similarities between movies. We then predict a user's unknown ratings by using these similarities in conjunction with the user's known ratings to initialize matrix factorization and {k-Nearest} Neighbours algorithms. We blend these results with existing ratings-based predictors. Finally, we discuss our empirical results, which suggest that external Wikipedia data does not significantly improve the overall prediction accuracy.},

@article{Evans1976Derivation,
    abstract = {The transport planning process as it is usually carried out consists of a number of stages. This paper considers commonly used models for two of these stages, trip distribution and traffic assignment, and derives models combining them into a single stage. The trip distribution stage of the transport planning is concerned with estimating the number of trips per unit time which will be made between each pair of zones in the study area. The models considered are all gravity models so that the estimated pattern of trips depends on the costs of travel between the various pairs of zones and these costs have usually been calculated from fixed costs associated with the links of the transport network. It is known, however, that the cost of travelling along a link increases with the amount of traffic using the link, and this is taken into account in the model used at the traffic assignment stage when the trip demands obtained from the trip distribution model are allocated to routes through the network. The link costs which correspond to the final estimated traffic flows obtained from the traffic assignment model are, however, not in general the same as those assumed at the trip distribution stage. In this paper this problem is overcome by combining trip distribution and traffic assignment into one stage and describing them by one model. The combined model is then reformulated as an equivalent optimatization problem which is solved.},

@article{Osorio2009Analytic,
    abstract = {Analytic queueing network models often assume infinite capacity queues due to the difficulty of grasping the between-queue correlation. This correlation can help to explain the propagation of congestion. We present an analytic queueing network model which preserves the finite capacity of the queues and uses structural parameters to grasp the between-queue correlation. Unlike pre-existing models it maintains the network topology and the queue capacities exogenous. Additionally, congestion is directly modeled via a novel formulation of the state space of the queues which explicitly captures the blocking phase. The model can therefore describe the sources and effects of congestion. The model is formulated for networks with an arbitrary topology, multiple server queues and blocking-after-service. It is validated by comparison with both pre-existing methods and simulation results. It is then applied to study patient flow in a network of units of the Geneva University Hospital. The model has allowed us to identify three main sources of bed blocking and to quantify their impact upon the different hospital units.},

We provide efficient algorithms, which have regret bounds with no dependence on the size of state space. Instead, these bounds depend only on a certain horizon time of the process and logarithmically on the number of actions. We also show that in the case that the dynamics change over time, the problem becomes computationally hard.},

Neurotransmission at {GABAA} receptors were modulated by means of pharmacological tools: the actions of the {GABAA} receptor positive allosteric modulator diazepam and inverse agonist/negative allosteric modulator {FG}-7142 were evaluated on septo-hippocampal activity. Systemic administration of diazepam inhibited, whereas {FG}-7142 enhanced [theta] oscillation of septal neurons and hippocampal {EEG} [theta] activity. In parallel to these experimental observations, a computational model has been constructed by implementing a septal {GABA} neuron model with a {CA1} hippocampal model containing three types of neurons (including oriens and basket interneurons and pyramidal cells; latter modeled by multicompartmental techniques; for detailed model description with network parameters see online addendum: http://geza.kzoo.edu/theta). This connectivity made the network capable of simulating the responses of the septo-hippocampal circuitry to the modulation of {GABAA} transmission, and the presently described computational model proved suitable to reveal several aspects of pharmacological modulation of {GABAA} receptors. In addition, computational findings indicated different roles of distinctively located {GABAA} receptors in [theta] generation.},

These simulations are time-consuming but also often intrinsically parallel. The recent advent of powerful and programmable graphic cards seems to be a pertinent solution to the problem: they offer a cheap but efficient possibility to serve as very fast co-processors for the parallel computing that spiking neural networks need. We describe our implementation of three different problems on such a card: two image-segmentation algorithms using spiking neural networks and one multi-purpose spiking neural-network simulator. Using these examples we show the benefits, the challenges and the limits of such an implementation.},

@article{daSilva2003Epilepsies,
    abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The occurrence of abnormal dynamics in a physiological system can become manifest as a sudden qualitative change in the behavior of characteristic physiologic variables. We assume that this is what happens in the brain with regard to epilepsy. We consider that neuronal networks involved in epilepsy possess multistable dynamics (i.e., they may display several dynamic states). To illustrate this concept, we may assume, for simplicity, that at least two states are possible: an interictal one characterized by a normal, apparently random, steady-state of ongoing activity, and another one that is characterized by the paroxysmal occurrence of a synchronous oscillations (seizure). {METHODS}: By using the terminology of the mathematics of nonlinear systems, we can say that such a bistable system has two attractors, to which the trajectories describing the system's output converge, depending on initial conditions and on the system's parameters. In phase-space, the basins of attraction corresponding to the two states are separated by what is called a "separatrix." We propose, schematically, that the transition between the normal ongoing and the seizure activity can take place according to three basic models: Model I: In certain epileptic brains (e.g., in absence seizures of idiopathic primary generalized epilepsies), the distance between "normal steady-state" and "paroxysmal" attractors is very small in contrast to that of a normal brain (possibly due to genetic and/or developmental factors). In the former, discrete random fluctuations of some variables can be sufficient for the occurrence of a transition to the paroxysmal state. In this case, such seizures are not predictable. Model {II} and model {III}: In other kinds of epileptic brains (e.g., limbic cortex epilepsies), the distance between "normal steady-state" and "paroxysmal" attractors is, in general, rather large, such that random fluctuations, of themselves, are commonly not capable of triggering a seizure. However, in these brains, neuronal networks have abnormal features characterized by unstable parameters that are very vulnerable to the influence of endogenous (model {II}) and/or exogenous (model {III}) factors. In these cases, these critical parameters may gradually change with time, in such a way that the attractor can deform either gradually or suddenly, with the consequence that the distance between the basin of attraction of the normal state and the separatrix tends to zero. This can lead, eventually, to a transition to a seizure. {RESULTS}: The changes of the system's dynamics preceding a seizure in these models either may be detectable in the {EEG} and thus the route to the seizure may be predictable, or may be unobservable by using only measurements of the dynamical state. It is thinkable, however, that in some cases, changes in the excitability state of the underlying networks may be uncovered by using appropriate stimuli configurations before changes in the dynamics of the ongoing {EEG} activity are evident. A typical example of model {III} that we discuss here is photosensitive epilepsy. {CONCLUSIONS}: We present an overview of these basic models, based on neurophysiologic recordings combined with signal analysis and on simulations performed by using computational models of neuronal networks. We pay especial attention to recent model studies and to novel experimental results obtained while analyzing {EEG} features preceding limbic seizures and during intermittent photic stimulation that precedes the transition to paroxysmal epileptic activity.},

The thin plate spline ({TPS}) warping is for the first time employed within the level set framework to model non-rigid deformations.

The multiphase level set formulation is new and of interest on its own: by construction, it automatically avoids the problems of vacuum and overlap; it needs only log n level set functions for n phases in the piecewise constant case; it can represent boundaries with complex topologies, including triple junctions; in the piecewise smooth case, only two level set functions formally suffice to represent any partition, based on The {Four-Color} Theorem. Finally, we validate the proposed models by numerical results for signal and image denoising and segmentation, implemented using the Osher and Sethian level set method.},

Researchers have developed collaborative recommenders, content-based recommenders, and a few hybrid systems. We propose a unified probabilistic framework for merging collaborative and content-based recommendations. We extend Hofmann\&\#039;s (1999) aspect model to incorporate three-way co-occurrence data among users, items, and item content. The relative influence of collaboration data versus content data is not imposed as an exogenous parameter, but rather emerges naturally from the given data sources. However, global probabilistic models coupled with standard {EM} learning algorithms tend to drastically overfit in the sparsedata situations typical of recommendation applications. We show that secondary content information can often be used to overcome sparsity. Experiments on data from the {ResearchIndex} library of Computer Science publications show that appropriate mixture models incorporating secondary data produce significantly better quality recommenders than k-nearest neighbors ({k-NN}). Global probabilistic models also allow more general inferences than local methods like {k-NN}.},

Information filtering ({IF}) focuses on the analysis of item content and the development of a personal user interest profile. Collaborative filtering ({CF}) focuses on identification of other users with similar tastes and the use of their opinions to recommend items. Each technique has advantages and limitations that suggest that the two could be beneficially combined. This paper shows that a {CF} framework can be used to combine personal {IF} agents and the opinions of a community of users to produce better recommendations than either agents or users can produce alone. It also shows that using {CF} to create a personal combination of a set of agents produces better results than either individual agents or other combination mechanisms. One key implication of these results is that users can avoid having to select among agents; they can use them all and let the {CF} framework select the best ones for them.},

We present {EM} algorithms for di erent variants of the aspect model and derive an approximate {EM} algorithm based onavariational principle for the two-sided clustering model. The bene ts of the di erentmodels are experimentally investigated on a large movie data set. 1},

@article{Tolliver2006Trip,
    abstract = {Large grain elevators are major sources of truck traffic in many areas. Shuttle trains, a recent railroad innovation, have further concentrated truck deliveries at larger elevators. These facilities—which have not been analyzed in previous trip generation studies—pose issues such as large truck access and pavement design. In this paper, elevator trip generation equations are estimated from detailed facility, land use, and highway traffic data in North Dakota. A trip attraction equation is used to explain the effects of elevator storage capacity and side track capacity on elevator throughput. Elevators are classified on the basis of track capacity as shuttle train, unit train, and multicar. Shuttle-train elevators typically consign 110-car trains, while unit-train elevators consign 50- to 100-car trains. The analysis shows that large shuttle-train elevators may generate 35,000 to 40,000 loaded and empty truck trips per year. A large unit-train elevator may generate 20,000 annual trips. The trucks are usually a mixture of combination five-axle and single-unit trucks. On average, each truck generates 1.04 equivalent single-axle loads on flexible pavements. Thus, a large facility may generate much of the traffic load experienced by pavements in the area. Moreover, truck deliveries to elevators exhibit seasonal variation. Approximately 15\\ of the annual volume is delivered during the peak month. Thus, a large shuttle facility may generate 225 trucks per day during the peak harvest month.},

The elevator domain poses a combination of challenges not seen in most {RL} research to date. Elevator systems operate in continuous state spaces and in continuous time as discrete event dynamic systems. Their states are not fully observable and they are nonstationary due to changing passenger arrival rates. In addition, we use a team of {RL} agents, each of which is responsible for controlling one elevator car. The team receives a global reinforcement signal which appears noisy to each agent due to the effects of the actions of the other agents, the random nature of the arrivals and the incomplete observation of the state. In spite of these complications, we show results that in simulation surpass the best of the heuristic elevator control algorithms of which we are aware. These results demonstrate the power of {RL} on a very large scale stochastic dynamic optimization problem of practical utility. 1},

However, interest has declined and government-sponsored efforts in this area have ceased. The decline in interest was accompanied by much debate among the advocates of the various forms of transit. However, it does not appear to reflect the potential merits and limitations of short headway systems as disclosed by analysis. This paper provides a basis for comparing short headway systems of citywide scale with conventional transit means. The limitations inherent in rapid rail installations are reviewed and contrasted with the performance of short headway systems. Illustrative, large-scale guideway configurations for systems operating in the three-second headway range are defined and levels of service are deduced using simplified heuristic methods. A basis is provided for specification and analysis of systems conforming to realistic spatial and passenger-movement constraints. It is concluded that automated transit systems operating in the three-second headway range remain viable candidates for large-scale installations.},

The aim of Metra's study was to identify ways of reducing the environmental nuisance of urban traffic without adding excessively to transport costs. The main theme of the article is that the traditional idea of an inherent conflict between transport efficiency and the environment is mistaken. Both efficiency and the environment are threatened by the same thing: the excessive and indiscriminate use of vehicles. This comes about because of defects in the fiscal and regulatory framework within which people take transport decisions. Suitable reforms in this framework would simultaneously enhance the environment and improve access for all classes of road user. In the development of this theme, particular attention is paid to transport activities which tend to be neglected by policy makers, such as walking, cycling and urban goods distribution; and to measures which are not always thought of as instruments of policy at all, such as locational policy and development control, vehicle design, and vehicle taxation, especially of goods vehicles.},

The foundations of the developed multi-objective approach, Evolutionary {Standardised-Objective} Weighted Aggregation Method, with a {PI}-controller operating as an interactive Decision Maker, are introduced. Their operation as a part of bi-objective genetic elevator group control is presented together with the performance results obtained from simulations concerning a high-rise office building. The results show that with this approach it is possible to regulate the service level of an elevator system, in terms of average passenger waiting time, so as to bring it to a desired level and to produce that service with minimum energy consumption.

The team objective is to maximize the total reward accumulated over a given time interval. Complicating factors include uncertainties regarding the locations of target points and the effectiveness of collecting rewards, differences among vehicle capabilities, and the fact that rewards are time-varying. We propose a receding horizon ({RH}) controller suitable for dynamic and uncertain environments, where combinatorially complex assignment algorithms are infeasible. The control scheme dynamically determines vehicle trajectories by solving a sequence of optimization problems over a planning horizon and executing them over a shorter action horizon. This centralized scheme can generate stationary trajectories in the sense that they guide vehicles to target points, even though the controller is not explicitly designed to perform any discrete point assignments. This paper establishes conditions under which this stationarity property holds in settings that are analytically tractable, quantifies the cooperative properties of the controller, and includes a number of illustrative simulation examples.},

Decision-theoretic reasoning plays a surprisingly limited role in fielded systems. A new opportunity for probabilistic methods has opened with the recent discovery of a tractable solution for the expected waiting times of all passengers in the building, marginalized over all possible passenger itineraries. Though commercially competitive, this solution does not contemplate future passengers. Yet in up-peak traffic, the effects of future passengers arriving at the lobby and entering elevator cars can dominate all waiting times. We develop a probabilistic model of how these arrivals affect the behavior of elevator cars at the lobby, and demonstrate how this model can be used to very significantly reduce the average waiting time of all passengers.},

    abstract = {We design a dispatching controller for elevator systems during uppeak passenger traffic with the ability to adapt to changing operating conditions. The design of this controller is motivated by our previous paper (1997) where we proved that for a queuing model of the uppeak dispatching problem a threshold policy is optimal (in the sense of minimizing the average passenger waiting time) with threshold parameters that depend on the passenger arrival rate. The controller, which we call the concurrent estimation dispatching algorithm ({CEDA}), uses concurrent estimation techniques for discrete-event systems. The {CEDA} allows us to observe the elevator system while it operates under some arbitrary thresholds, and concurrently estimate, in an unobtrusive way, what the waiting time would have been had the system operated under a set of different thresholds. These concurrently estimated waiting times are used to adapt the operating thresholds to match the elevator service rate to a changing passenger arrival rate. Implementation issues relating to the limited state information provided by actual elevator systems are resolved in a way that maintains modest computational requirements and avoids the need for supplemental sensors beyond those already typically provided. Numerical performance results show the advantages of the {CEDA} over currently used dispatching algorithms for uppeak},

@article{Pepyne1997Optimal,
    abstract = {In this paper we develop optimal dispatching controllers for elevator systems during uppeak traffic. An uppeak traffic period arises when the bulk of the passenger traffic is moving from the first door up into the building (e.g., the start of a business day in an office building). The cars deliver the passengers and then return empty to the first floor to pick up more passengers. We show that the structure of the optimal dispatching policy minimizing the discounted or average passenger waiting time is a threshold-based policy. That is, the optimal policy is to dispatch an available car from the first floor when the number of passengers inside the car reaches or exceeds a threshold that depends on several factors including the passenger arrival rate, elevator performance capabilities, and the number of elevators available at the first floor. Since most elevator systems have sensors to determine the car locations and the number of passengers in each car, such a threshold policy is easily implemented. Our analysis is based on a Markov decision problem formulation with a batch service queueing model consisting of a single queue served by multiple finite-capacity bulk servers. We use dynamic programming techniques to obtain the structure of the optimal control policy and to derive some of its important properties. Several numerical examples are included to illustrate our results and to compare the optimal threshold policy to some known ad hoc approaches. Finally, since many transportation systems can be modeled as multiserver batch service queueing systems, we expect our results to be useful in controlling those systems as well},

The performance of an {EGCS} is measured by means of several metrics such as the average waiting time of passengers, the percentage of the passengers waiting more than some predetermined time, power consumption, among others. Four elevator dispatching algorithms are analyzed and implemented using reconfigurable architectures based on {FPGAs}. The system is based on Local Controller Systems ({LCSs}), one for each elevator, and a protocol based on an {RS485} network for interconnecting the {LCSs}. The {FPGAs} implement the {LCSs}. A Java interface was implemented for testing and monitoring the system and the {EGCS} function. The novelty of this approach is that the {LCSs} are capable to run the different dispatching algorithms, which are suitable for different passenger traffic situations, while the {EGCS} only must determine the best algorithm to be run in each {LCS}. The data traffic in the network is reduced given that the {EGCS} is not directly involved in calculating next floors to be visited.

The chain is evaluated efficiently using dynamic programming to compute measures of future system performance such as expected waiting time, properly averaged over all possible future scenarios. An elevator group scheduler based on this method significantly outperforms a conventional algorithm based on minimization of proxy criteria such as the time needed for all cars to complete their assigned deliveries. For a wide variety of buildings, ranging from 8 to 30 floors, and with 2 to 8 shafts, our algorithm reduces waiting times up to 70 \% in heavy traffic, and exhibits an average waiting-time speed-up of 20 \\ in a test set of 20,000 building types and traffic patterns. While the algorithm has greater computational costs than most conventional algorithms, it is linear in the size of the building and number of shafts, and quadratic in the number of passengers, and is completely within the computational capabilities of currently existing elevator bank control systems.},

    abstract = {Not widely known by the {AI} community, elevator control has become a major eld of application for {AI} technologies. Techniques such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, fuzzy rules, and, recently, multi-agent systems and {AI} planning have been adopted by leading elevator companies not only to improve the transportation capacity of conventional elevator systems, but also to revolutionize the way in which elevators interact with and serve passengers. In this paper, we begin with an overview of {AI} techniques adopted by this industry and explain the motivations behind the continuous interest in {AI}. We review and summarize publications that are not easily accessible from the common {AI} sources. In the second part, we present in more detail a recent development project to apply {AI} planning and multi-agent systems to elevator control problems. 1 Challenge of Ecient Vertical Transport Like many other industries, the elevator industry is currently facing two main challenges: (1) The continuous pressure to lower construction costs of buildings requires that the core space occupied by an elevator installation be reduced and that transportation performance be signicantly improved. (2) Increasing competition requires a diversication strategy to provide new and individually tailored services to passengers. Most of the physical components of an elevator (e.g., drives and shaft installations) are invisible to the passenger and can be exchanged without even being noticed, but the available services and their quality determine how an elevator installation is perceived by the customer. Not surprisingly, elevator companies have developed a demand for new technologies and are adopting {AI} techniques to address the aforementioned goals. To understand the underlying control issues, let us recall how elevators usually work.},

Oering an individually tailored service to passengers while maintaining a high transportation capacity of an elevator group is an upcoming challenge in the elevator business, which cannot be met by software methods traditionally used in this industry. {AI} planning oers a novel solution to these control problems: (1) by synthesizing the optimal control for any situation occurring in a building based on fast search algorithms, (2) by implementing a domain model, which allows to easily add new features to the control software. By embedding the planner into a multi-agent system, real-time interleaved planning and execution is implemented and results in a highperforming, self-adaptive, and modular control software. 1 Customization and Eciency challenge Innovation As many other industries, elevator companies are facing two main challenges today: (1) the pressure on building costs requires to improve the transportation capacity of elevator installations, (2) increasing competition challenges diversi cation and mass customization strategies, which aim at providing new and individually tailored services to passengers.},

To our knowledge, fuzzy logic has traditionally been used to support the more established techniques, such as expert knowledge base approaches.

We characterize a bursty arrival process using bursts which consist of the same kind of jobs. Once the first job of a burst arrives at the queue, the successive jobs will arrive on every time slot until the last job of the burst arrives. The numbers of jobs of a burst and the inter-arrival times of bursts are assumed to be i.i.d., respectively, and the service time is assumed to be equal to one slot. We propose an efficient numerical method to exactly obtain the job loss probability, the waiting time distribution and the mean queue length.

The server is not allowed to process a group of size less than a, 1≤ a≤ b. The actual size of each group served depends on the number of waiting customers. The queue is studied as a Markov process. In the stable case, the stationary probability vector of this process has a simple, readily computable form. Using this form, the stationary waiting time distribution, which is analytically intractable, may be expressed in an algorithmically useful form. Several questions, related to the optimal design of such a service system, may be algorithmically investigated. This model serves to illustrate the advantages of the algorithmic approach.

@inproceedings{Ceballos2004Queue,
    abstract = {Multi-server queuing analysis can be used to estimate average wait times and queue lengths at toll and parking exit plazas given arrival rates, number of servers, and service rates. These queuing models approximate the performance of queuing systems with multiple queues. While the queuing equations are useful where there are multiple servers, they do not fully reflect the operation of a toll plaza where vehicles can stack in multiple queues and can change lanes. To gain an understanding of how such a system will operate, a traffic simulation model that reflects the specified vehicle arrival and service rates, and allows for multiple channel arrivals was applied to several parking exit plaza concepts. This paper compares the results obtained from both methods and describes how these estimations compared with queue and waiting time data collected at exit plazas in actual operation. The analysis described in this paper was based on the application of the analytical queuing model in conjunction with traffic simulation in parking exit plazas at four different airports: the Ronald Regan Washington National Airport, the Dulles International Airport, the Salt Lake City International Airport, and the Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport. The measures of effectiveness used to evaluate the models performance were average and maximum queuing delay, and average and maximum queuing length. Additionally, the output values, including the throughput volume estimated by the simulation model were compared to collected field values. The paper shows that simulation provides a more comprehensive understanding of the toll plaza operation allowing for a more in-depth analysis of its performance. While the simple queuing models could be used as an initial, in some cases more conservative estimation in early stages of planning, simulation should be used for advance planning, design, operation and management of toll and exit plaza facilities.},

For example, in the ubiquitous home environments, plenty of context information can be obtained from various home sensors, and this information can be exploited for smart home activities. This paper presents a new elevator scheduling system for smart apartment buildings that exploits the ubiquitous sensor technologies. In the proposed elevator scheduling system, floor sensors are located at each floor of the apartment building and detect the candidate elevator passengers' behavior before they come to the elevator door and push the elevator call button. The detected information is then delivered to the elevator scheduling system through the building network and the elevator scheduling system utilizes this information in the efficient control of the elevator. Through extensive simulations with various passengers' traffic conditions, we show that the proposed system performs better than the conventional elevator scheduling system in terms of the passengers' average waiting time, the maximum waiting time, and the energy consumption of the elevator significantly.},

Hall call waiting times ({HWTs}) are estimated by a statistic approximation of traffic data, which are reasonably accurate under different kinds of real traffic situations. Two assignment policies are proposed to satisfy the passengers' demands and to handle exceptional situations. In addition, these policies are extended in order to reduce the variance of {HWTs} and long {HWTs}. The performance of the elevator system employing the proposed policies are compared with each others in terms of several performance indices by computer simulation},

    abstract = {A method for controlling an elevator group of double-deck elevators. Landing calls are allocated to the elevators and elevator decks in such a way that the passenger journey time is optimized. The method takes into account the current landing call time and the estimated time of arrival to the destination floor. The method minimizes passenger journey time by allocating the landing call to the deck that will cause the fewest additional stops to the elevator and least additional delay on the way to the passenger destination floor. In addition, the elevator estimated time of arrival to a destination floor is calculated separately for each deck, taking into account the stops already existing for the elevator and the additional stops caused by the selected landing call. Further the landing call is allocated to the deck for which the estimated time of arrival to the destination floor is least. In addition, the best deck for each landing call is selected by minimizing a cost function. The cost function may include the estimated time of arrival to the destination floor. Alternatively, the cost function may also include the estimated time of arrival to the furthest call floor.},

    abstract = {In a building, effective operations of transportation systems including elevators, escalators, and stairs are vital. Among them, group elevator scheduling has long been recognized as an important issue for transportation efficiency. The problem, however, is difficult because of the large state space, various traffic profiles, and uncertainties. With the progress in information technology and sensor networks, one potential way is to use advanced traffic information to reduce uncertainties and optimize the performance. How to effectively utilize such information remains an open and challenging issue. This paper presents the optimized scheduling of a group of elevators with advanced traffic information for normal operations and coordinated emergency evacuation. A look-ahead time window is first introduced to model advanced information. Key characteristics of group elevator scheduling are abstracted to establish an innovative formulation. The objective function is transformed into an additive form to facilitate the decomposition of the problem into individual car subproblems. Subproblems are independently solved by using a local search method in conjunction with dynamic programming with a novel definition of stages, states, decisions, and costs to optimize single car dispatching. With surrogate optimization, local search is \&\#8220;good enough\&\#8221; to set multiplier updating directions. Individual cars are then coordinated through the updating of multipliers by using surrogate optimization for near-optimal solutions. Numerical testing results demonstrate that near-optimal solutions are obtained for problems of moderate sizes under selected traffic patterns. The results also show the value of advanced information through testing different window sizes and rescheduling intervals.},

@article{Zhao1997Surrogate,
    abstract = {A key step of Lagrangian relaxation is to optimize the dual function, and the subgradient method is frequently used when the dual function is nondifferentiable. However, the subgradient method requires minimizing all the subproblems to obtain the subgradient direction, and for problems of large size this may be very time consuming. To overcome this difficulty, the  ” interleaved subgradient method” minimizes only one subproblem to obtain a direction. Numerical results show that the interleaved subgradient method converges faster than the subgradient method, though algorithm convergence was not established. In this paper, the  ” surrogate subgradient method” is constructed, where a direction can be obtained without minimizing all the subproblems. In fact, only near optimization of one subproblem is necessary to obtain a proper surrogate subgradient direction. The convergence of the algorithm is proved, where the interleaved subgradient method can be viewed as a special case of this general method. Compared with methods which take efforts to find a better direction, the surrogate gradient method saves efforts in obtaining a direction and thus provides a different approach which is especially powerful for large size problems},

The methodology developed in this paper combines fundamental properties of convex sets in order to decompose the multicriterion control problem into a two-level structure. The upper level of this structure comprises only decision-making aspects of the problem, and involves the solution of a relaxed and static multicriterion problem. The lower level of the structure comprises, in turn, only optimal control aspects of the problem. The overall procedure is easily implemented. The solution of the aggregated problem is obtained as the limit of a sequence of optimal control problems that preserve their original solution properties. Relationships between the approach adopted here and existing solution techniques are discussed. The solutions of the classical minimax and Salukvadze problems are obtained as special cases of the proposed approach.},

Groups of agents with such mechanisms could be used in applications including market-based control, internet commerce, and economic modelling. After an introductory discussion of the rationale for this work, and a brief overview of key concepts from economics, work in market-based control is reviewed to highlight the need for bargaining agents. Following this, the early experimental economics work of Smith (1962) and the recent results of Gode and Sunder (1993) are described. Gode and Sunder\&\#039;s work, using \&amp;quot;zero-intelligence \&amp;quot; (zi) traders that act randomly within a structured market, appears to imply that convergence to the theoretical equilibrium price is determined more by market structure than by the intelligence of the traders in that market: if this is true, developing mechanisms for bargaining agents is of very limited relevance. However, it is demonstrated here that the average transaction prices of zi traders can vary significantly from the theoretical equilibrium level when supply and demand are asymmetric, and that the degree of difference from equilibrium is predictable from a priori},

To tackle our problem, we make use of powerful tools from semigroup theory in Banach space and a decomplexification technique. The solution for the problem relies, in part, on the study of a countably infinite set of coupled algebraic Riccati equations ({ICARE}). Conditions for existence and uniqueness of a positive semidefinite solution of the {ICARE} are obtained via the extended concepts of stochastic stabilizability ({SS}) and stochastic detectability ({SD}).

    abstract = {The problem of precise longitudinal control of vehicles so that they follow predetermined time-varying speeds and positions has been solved. To control vehicles to the required close headway of at least 0.5 sec, the control philosophy is different from but no less rigorous than that of railroad practice. The preferred control strategy is one that could be called an "asynchronous point follower." Such a strategy requires no clock synchronization, is flexible in all unusual conditions, permits the maximum possible throughput, requires a minimum of maneuvering and uses a minimum of software. Since wayside zone controllers have in their memory exactly the same maneuver equations as the on-board computers, accurate safety monitoring is practical. The paper discusses the functions of vehicle control; the control of station, merge, and diverge zones; and central control.},

@article{Anderson2005SkyWeb,
    abstract = {Numerous investigators, observing that conventional transit systems are no match for the automobile on a modern road, have sought a means for movement of people that would attract many more riders while reducing costs. Understanding the benefits of automation, this activity led to the consideration of systems consisting of very small, automatically controlled vehicles running on a network of small, low-cost elevated guideways. To obtain adequate capacity and to decrease trip time, the stations would be placed off-line. In this way the system would have the attractiveness of a freeway, which permits private travel at minimum trip time, but would require a great deal less space. In the late 1960s this concept became called Personal Rapid Transit ({PRT}) and governments began investing in it. Unfortunately, there are a great many ways to design a {PRT} system and at that early stage there was no serious theoretical work to determine how best to accomplish such a design. As, a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Minnesota, the author became interested in this problem in 1968 and during the 1970s was able to study all of the {PRT} work underway around the world, and thereby develop a. comprehensive set of criteria to guide him to an optimized version of {PRT}. That version is now called {SkyWeb} Express. The paper briefly discusses the advantages of use of off-line stations and the design of the necessary guideway, vehicle, station, operations, and control system. Means for obtaining the necessary safety and reliability are then discussed, followed by a brief discussion of system costs and cost effectiveness. Finally, a list is given of benefits for the community and the patrons.},

    abstract = {Personal rapid transit ({PRT}) accommodates groups of passengers that request transport to a desired destination. Empty vehicles need to be moved to stations with waiting passengers or with expected demand. Efficient redistribution of empty vehicles is critical in larger {PRT} networks, which have running times longer than acceptable waiting times. Previous studies have developed methods for allocating destinations to empty {PRT} vehicles sequentially as they become available. This study refines the allocation of empty vehicles into three stages. The first stage is essentially the previous sequential allocation. In the second and third stages, empty vehicles en route are reallocated by switching destinations. In the second stage, waiting passengers are allocated the nearest vehicle on the basis of waiting time. In the third stage, the remaining empty vehicles en route are reallocated on the basis of minimum running distance. The optimization problem in the third stage corresponds to the transportation problem, and it is solved approximately by a heuristic method suggested by Russel. Applied to a network with 25 stations, 16 km of guideway, and 200 vehicles, the combined reallocation methods reduced average waiting and the longest wait to about half compared with sequential decisions alone.},

An outline of {IPELM} design is presented for consideration and further development. Safety issues are reviewed for this linear motor. The main advantage of {IPELM} over {LSM} is the ability to control many vehicles on the same guideway with a very short headway and space between vehicles. A further development of {IPELM} makes it possible to design a continuous nonstop transit system with a high schedule speed between many online stations.},

Old adults also enjoy beneficial effects of spacing when the item is to be recognized, but suffer detrimental effects of the spacing manipulation when the item is to be rejected: They falsely endorse the spaced to-be-rejected items more than the massed ones. This dissociation also obtains with young subjects under conditions of increased time pressure: Under normal decision conditions, the ability to endorse to-be-recognized items and to reject to-be-rejected items increases with spacing; under speeded conditions, the ability to reject the latter items decreases with spacing. The results support the notion that source memory is selectively impaired in the elderly and that it is difficult to access mnemonic information about source under time pressure.},

We present the modelling approach and development of a tool capable of being used for lift performance evaluation/ prediction of existing/new hospital designs.

@article{Cortes2005Microsimulation,
    abstract = {The use of microsimulation is not prevalent in modeling transit systems. The software available is rarely capable of modeling transit systems that route vehicles in real time or systems that adjust to the level of demand. It is not straightforward to model a transit system with the available simulation packages, especially when the transit scheme is not "standard." Even the simulation of basic schemes such as a streetcar system or a paratransit service is not an option in existing simulation software. A cursory study would reveal that simulation of any vehicle class other than personal automobiles is always developed as an afterthought in the existing large-scale microsimulation packages. In most cases, simulation developers have done only a superficial addition of transit simulation on top of detailed simulation of automobiles and control mechanisms on freeways and arterials. A microsimulation framework has been developed for a general transit system. Concrete applications of such a framework have been developed and are presented in this paper. Two different transit systems are modeled using the same general framework to show the flexibility of the simulation scheme: a bus rapid transit system and a large-scale real-time routed transit design. The intent is to describe the flexibility that can be brought into a properly designed microscopic simulation platform to model innovative transit system designs, especially in larger urban networks. A simulation scenario is presented in which both transit systems function. The details of both simulations are described along with the problems encountere, an ways to solve them are exposed.},

Numerous decisions have to be taken to obtain an accurate, comfortable, and high-quality service. Effectively, the optimization algorithm is a key factor in the design process, but so are the number of cars being installed, their technical characteristics, the kinematics of the elevator group, and some other design parameters, which cause the selection task of the elevator system to be a complex one. In this context, the design of decision support tools is becoming a real necessity that most important companies are including as part of their strategic plans. In this article, the authors present a user-friendly planning and simulating tool for dynamic vertical traffic. The tool is conceptualized for giving support in the planning and design stage of the elevator system, in order to collaborate in the selection of the type of elevator (number, type of dynamic, capacity, etc.) and the optimization algorithm.},

@article{Cottrell2006Moving,
    abstract = {Driverless transit features vehicles or transit units functioning with no onboard intervention from a driver or attendant. In comparison with traditional transit, driverless transit offers reduced labor costs and smaller vehicles, albeit with higher capital costs, and better performance records. As of 2005 there were 37 driverless transit systems in urban service, with five in the United States. Fifteen cities in Canada, Europe, and East Asia had driverless metros. To move driverless transit into the mainstream, research is needed in multiple areas. This paper examines research needs identified in 12 papers presented at the 10th International Conference on Automated People Movers ({APMS}), with supplemental information from related literature. Integrating {APMs} into airport security infrastructure, the development of lightweight materials for vehicles and guideways, and personal rapid transit ({PRT}) reliability and systems theory are among the high-priority research challenges. Medium-priority research needs would focus on special applications of and revenue generators for driverless transit. Although a great deal of driverless transit research has been conducted in simulation, there is a need for operating and performance data from existing systems. These data would enable driverless transit to be considered in modal alternatives analysis. Also, to bring concepts such as {PRT} into reality, full-scale models need to be tested in operational environments. It is argued that research supported by industry and local agency consortiums can make incremental advancements, but extensive studies require committed, high-level government funding. While the development of driverless transit in the United States has been stifled by high-profile cost overruns and abandonments, successful applications in Europe or elsewhere may revive domestic investment. Potential driverless transit research funding resources are suggested.},

@article{Cottrell2008Newgeneration,
    abstract = {An overview and a comparison of several new-generation personal rapid transit ({PRT}) technologies are provided. A total of about 40 known {PRT} concepts existed as of 2007, of which 19 were being actively developed (i.e., not dormant, with some testing completed). Of the 19, 10 had readily accessible operational specifications, enabling an assessment and comparison. Ten operational parameters were considered for each or the technologies. A throughput of 7,200 passengers pier hour on a single-track {PRT} line is possible with a minimum headway of 1.0 s, line speed of 35 km/h, and braking rate of 9.8 m/s(2) (i.e., G(x)). A minimum headway of 0.5 s is possible either at low speeds (<20 km/h) or with hard emergency braking (>= {2G}(x)). {PRT} technologies proposing values that exceed these limits may not be feasible. To accommodate short headways and high emergency braking rates, controls that require seated passengers should be considered. Only Urban Light Transport and Vectus feature a full slate of either feasible or fundamental (i.e., preferable) operating characteristics. {CyberCab} and {MISTER} would be more feasible with decreases in minimum headway and line speed, respectively. The other technologies are partially feasible, unclear in terms of certain characteristics, or better classified as "high-speed" {PRT}. The findings may facilitate the formulation of {PRT} standards and operating criteria. These, along with a successful implementation of {PRT} at Heathrow Airport in England, may generate new markets and competitive technologies. Further studies comparing guideway design, materials, switching, station design, visual impacts, costs, and financing are needed.},

Traffic analysis may lead to the use of a large number of lifts in one building at the same time in a multiplex mode, which increases the energy consumed. The number of installed lifts depends on the service quality of the building and the total population. Recent methods proved that the energy consumption of lifts can be reduced by limiting the number of lifts in service without compromising the service quality. Photocells and screens are placed in front of each lift to count the number of people using the lift. Fuzzy logic is used to decide about switching {ON} or {OFF} the lifts, according to the total population and grade of service at a certain time. This is a useful method to optimize and control the energy used in lifts within a building management system.},

While such definitions correctly describe the availability of a system and its equipment to function they do not directly measure the percent of designed and scheduled service available for passenger use. For the more complex transportation systems having multiple tracks and routes, fleets of vehicles, more than two stations and more than one mode of service there are needs for definitions that account for isolated failures that partially interrupt or delay service. Successful definitions of service availability have been based on data that is easily and directly entered in the operating log or automatically collected by Automatic Train Supervision ({ATS}) system and reports generated by software. The following paper first defines measures of service availability in current use and analyzes exact and approximation methods for data collection and computation. Second, the paper postulates and explores classical and new definitions of service availability applicable for complex networks such as Personal Rapid {Transit(PRT}). Insight is provided for choosing a suitable definition based on the type of transportation network.},

Artificial neural networks are applied in {Duplex/Triplex} group control systems for improving passenger waiting time. The backpropagation algorithm is used for training neural networks. The elevator traffic analysis and simulation results are presented and compared to conventional elevator control systems. (C) 2008 Journal of Mechanical Engineering. All rights reserved.},

@article{Janiszewski2003Metaanalysis,
    abstract = {The effects of repeated advertising exposures depend on the size of the interval, or space, between ad exposures. A meta-analysis of 97 verbal learning studies identified several stimulus characteristics and learning context factors that interact with stimulus spacing to facilitate memory for repeated information. The majority of the findings are consistent with the predictions of two enhanced processing explanations of learning-the retrieval hypothesis and the reconstruction hypothesis. These two hypotheses predict that an effective repetition strategy should encourage incidental processing during one presentation of the material and intentional processing during the other presentation of the material, but the hypotheses differ about the optimal order of these two types of processing. Thus, the most effective repetition strategy may be a combination of spaced exposures that alternate in terms of media that are involving (e.g., television commercials) and less involving (e.g., billboards, product placements).},

@article{Johnson2005Doubling,
    abstract = {A new personal rapid transit ({PRT}) operating policy is specified; it can often double peak period capacity with moderate wait times. When a passenger selects a destination for a vehicle, the destination is displayed for all to see. Any waiting passenger going to the same destination can also board. However, vehicles are not delayed just to gather additional riders. Fares are charged per person, rather than per vehicle. If the passenger queue length happens to equal the number of destinations and all destinations are equally likely, it is shown that on average one extra passenger will board each vehicle and that vehicle occupancy and line capacity will approximately double. The average wait time in this case will be approximately {N/(2R}), where N is the number of destinations and R is the vehicle arrival rate at the origin station. A station layout that facilitates this ridesharing policy is presented, and security measures are described for strangers traveling together. Simulation results give occupancy values up to 18\% higher than expected from a simple model. During peak periods with directional flows, passengers facing a long wait can choose to travel to a destination near their own with no passenger queue and from there immediately board a vehicle to continue to their original destination. This makes ridesharing feasible in relatively large {PRT} systems.},

In the double winding {LIM}, two sets of windings are wound in a single yoke, and each of them are controlled by separate inverters. Therefore, the flux continuity must be provided in the region where the two windings are overlaid. Providing flux continuity is interpreted as aligning two flux angles. If the flux angles of two {LIMs} are not identical, then abrupt flux change occurs in the overlaid region, causing loss and coupling between two inverter systems. To align two flux angles, we propose a flux aligning controller by exchanging angle information through {RS}-232 communication and analyze its performance under the disturbance. We discuss the fault-tolerant operation algorithm and compare the {PRT} system with the other transport systems.},

One of the latest innovations in this field is the Accelerating Moving Walkway ({AMW}), which provides higher transport speed. However, the application of moving walkways is still limited to short-distance travel up to 300 m. This paper summarizes and analyses the findings of a literature review on (accelerating) moving walkways, which aims to compare the characteristics of {AMWs} with other public transport systems, namely buses, light rails, Automated People Movers ({APMs}), and Personal Rapid Transits ({PRTs}). Based on the comparative evaluation, we conclude that {AMW}'s can be competitive to the other transport modes. Hence, we propose the potential application of {AMWs} for the transport of people, i.e. pedestrians, over longer distances. Subsequently, issues related to the concept of long-distance {AMWs} are briefly introduced as topics for further research. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Li1997Inner,
    abstract = {There are many skyscrapers in large cities such as Tokyo, Beijing, Shanghai etc., mainly with rectangular parallelepiped shapes and some with frustum shapes, which is caused by the soaring of the land price. In a very big building with many people, it is well known that the inner traffic carl not be ignored and it is important to forecast the inner traffic so that a sufficiently large inner traffic space is designed to guarantee the people to move in the building smoothly. Here, the inner traffic generally means the vertical inner traffic. Basically, there are two kinds of the inner traffic inside a skyscraper. One is the so-called {Outside-Inside} inner traffic, which is the traffic by the people coming from outside to inside or by the people going from inside to Outside. Another one is the so-called {Inside-Inside} inner traffic, which is the traffic by the people acting within a skyscraper. As an example of {Outside-Inside} inner traffic, Okudaira gave a formulation in 1976. By considering the rush hours when the elevators are mostly occupied by the working people, he derived the theoretical distribution of the inner traffic area and the dwelling area in a rectangular skyscraper. Also as an example of {Inside-Inside} inner traffic, Taguchi gave another formulation in 1994. By considering the communication among the people inside a skyscraper, he calculated the distribution of the inner traffic area and the dwelling area in a rectangular skyscraper by combining a theoretical method and Newton numerical method. The above two models are formulated based on one kind of the inner traffic and they are reasonable for some special cases. For instance, Okudaira model may be valid for an office building during the rush hours. and Taguchi model may be valid for a residential building in the holidays. However, we daily experience that several kinds of the inner traffic generally exist in a skyscraper, for example, with respect to {Inside-Inside} inner traffic, there exist not only the traffic due to the communication among the people inside a skyscraper, but also the traffic caused by the allocation of a public facility etc., showing the incorporation of these traffics is meaningful. On the other hand, the above two models are limited to a rectangular skyscraper. However, there appear more and more frustum skyscrapers recently, meaning the generalization of the shape of a skyscraper is also important. Here in this paper, we give the formulation combining one {Outside-Inside} inner traffic and one {Inside-Inside} inner traffic in a frustum skyscraper. Concretely, we consider Okudaira model for {Outside-Inside} inner traffic, and we consider Taguchi model, the allocation problem proposed in this paper for {Inside-Inside} inner traffic respectively. Moreover, since most skyscrapers have the shape of rectangular type, not frustum one, also in this paper, we theoretically analyze the distribution of the inner traffic area and the dwelling area with respect to rectangular case, Finally, we apply all of them to some examples for various parameter values. The numerical analysis shows that the result obtained by Okudaira and Taguchi, which says that the remainder of building volume after taking the elevator passage is scarcely dependent on the height of the building and thus the most of the investment on a high skyscraper may be masted, is also meaningful in such an extension. Further, it shows that the dwelling area is much more affected by the bottom area and the location of a public facility as the occuring rate of {Outside-Inside} inner traffic decreases in a skyscraper.},

@article{Livadas1998Formal,
    abstract = {This paper investigates how formal techniques can be used for the analysis and verification of hybrid systems [1, 5, 7, 16] - systems involving both discrete and continuous behavior. The motivation behind such research lies in the inherent similarity of the hierarchical and decentralized control strategies of hybrid systems and the communication and operation protocols used for distributed systems in computer science. This paper focuses on the use of hybrid {I/O} automata [11,12] to model, analyze, and verify safety-critical hybrid systems that use emergency control subsystems to prevent the violation of their safety requirements. The paper is split into two parts. First, we develop an abstract model of a protector - an emergency control component that guarantees that the physical plant at hand adheres to a particular safety requirement. The abstract protector model specialized to a particular physical plant and a particular safety requirement constitutes the specification of a protector that enforces the particular safety property for the particular physical plant. The correctness proof of the abstract protector model leads to simple correctness proofs of the implementations of particular protectors. In addition, the composition of independent protectors, and even dependent protectors under mild conditions, guarantees the conjunction of the safety properties guaranteed by the individual protectors being composed. Second, as a case study, we specialize the aforementioned abstract protector model to simplified versions of the personal rapid transit system ({PRT} {2000(TM})) under development at Raytheon Corporation and verify the correctness of overspeed and collision avoidance protectors. Such correctness proofs are repeated for track topologies ranging from a single track to a directed graph of tracks involving Y-shaped merges and diverges.},

Three expanded/equal interval schedule pairings, matched in average spacing (1-2-3/2-2-2; 1-3-5/3-3-3; and 1-3-8/4-4-4), were compared, and the effect of retention interval on spaced retrieval benefits was examined by comparing performance on a same day test to a test delayed by 24 h. Both age groups showed a learning phase retrieval success advantage for expanded items compared to equal interval items. Only older adults in the same day test condition showed a significant expansion effect in final recall. After a 24-h delay, the final recall advantage for items in the expanded condition was lost in both groups, and in fact these items were at a significant recall disadvantage for younger adults. Results indicate that younger and older adults benefit from a rehearsal technique that incorporated any type of spaced retrieval whether it is distributed as an expanding schedule or not. Although we did not find robust advantages for expanded retrieval compared to equal interval practice, there could be certain advantages (such as reinforcement due to high success rates) to using expanded retrieval depending on the ultimate goals of an individual memory training program.},

@article{Lowson2002Sustainable,
    abstract = {Transport by conventional means involves energy use, resource use and emission output which cannot be regarded as sustainable. Current transport is dominated by the car. This provides the flexible personal transport required by modern forms of cities, but is widely recognised as unsustainable. Current public transport is poorly accepted. Unfortunately, analysis also shows that current forms of public transport offer little, or even negative, benefit in sustainability over the car. A new transport system has been devised to meet the need for transport which is both effective and sustainable. {ULTra} (Urban Light Transport) is an innovative form of Personal Rapid Transit ({PRT}). In contrast to previous forms of public transport, there is no waiting, no stopping and no transfers within the system. In many circumstances, it can offer better transport than available by other means. {ULTra} has been designed to demanding sustainability requirements. Typically, {ULTra} provides a reduction by a factor of 3 in energy use and emissions output over existing forms of transport. {ULTra} is also complementary to existing forms of transport. By providing a network link to major rail or bus stations, it can improve the attraction of current transport services. Evaluations undertaken for the Department of Transport and supported by recent questionnaire studies, suggest that a comprehensive {ULTra} system could attract 25-30\% of present car drivers. {ULTra} is now undergoing engineering development funded by the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions. Cardiff County Council has received funding commitments from the National Assembly of Wales which will lead to initial implementation of a system by 2005. It is believed that the system offers a new approach to public transport with a real prospect of significant gains in effectiveness and sustainability.},

    abstract = {An effective and sustainable transport system has been devised to meet public transport demand. Urban light transport ({ULTra}) is an innovative form of personal rapid transit. In contrast to other forms of public transport, there is no waiting, stopping, or transferring. In many situations, the new system can offer better transport than available by other means. {ULTra} has been designed to demanding sustainability requirements. Typically, {ULTra} reduces energy use and emissions by a factor of three compared with existing transport systems and also complements those systems. By providing a network link to major rail and bus stations, {ULTra} can make current transport services more attractive to passengers. The new system is also well suited for other major activity centers such as airports. In essence, {ULTra} replaces the old mass transit paradigm for transport with a new paradigm based on just-in-time transit. {ULTra} is now undergoing engineering development funded by the {U.K}. Department for Transport on a 1-km test track in Cardiff, Wales. The Cardiff County Council has received funding commitments by the National Assembly of Wales that could lead to system implementation by 2005. The system offers a new approach to public transport, with a real prospect of significant gains in effectiveness and sustainability.},

    abstract = {Personal rapid transit ({PRT}) systems offer a series of new opportunities for effective solution of airport-related transport problems, both on the landside and airside of the airport. A comparative analysis is offered of the potential advantages and disadvantages of this form transport for airport applications. The work is illustrated by a case study of the application of the {ULTra} {PRT} system to serve passenger and staff car parks at Heathrow. The small scale and flexibility of the {ULTra} infrastructure allow use of the tunnel side bores and provide unexpectedly simple integration with the complex central terminal area. Detailed comparisons show a benefit of 60\% in trip time and 40\% in operating cost over current buses. The study shows that forms of transport are well matched to landside applications for ports. An outline evaluation of possible benefits for airside is also presented.},

    abstract = {Analysis of current types of public transport shows that they are mismatched to geography of modern towns, the form of which is dominated by the availability of the car. A new kind of public transport has been sought which can meet both the requirements of the user for effective transport, and the non-user for an exemplary urban environment. It has been found that exploitation of existing technologies can meet these requirements in a new type of transport. This can be described as a personal automatic taxi system running on its own guideway network. It is shown that this can offer effective transportation at energy and emission costs which are reduced by an order of magnitude compared to the current car-road system. Initial studies also suggest that the new system can be economically viable. The new transport system, which is an improved version of types previously proposed under the general description of personal rapid transit, appears to offer an attractive and genuinely sustainable alternative to the car for urban transport in the next century.},

Growth in the global fleet has overwhelmed past efforts to reduce overall oil consumption and pollution emissions. Electric vehicles offer the most promising longterm option to reduce emissions of carbon-dioxide emissions and pollution, with the electricity and hydrogen for these vehicles eventually derived from non-fossil energy sources. A new form of electrified public transportation system called Personal Rapid Transit ({PRT}) is being developed in the United States. Based on small computer-operated 3-passenger electric cars riding on their own narrow guideways, {PRT} systems will be far less costly to build and operate than conventional heavy-and light-rail systems. The introduction of electric cars and trucks along with {PRT} systems for public transport will be an important first step in the evolution of a sustainable, global transportation system.},

Beyond the initial context storage, increases in study time or different orienting tasks do not influence the amount of context that is stored, and thus only spaced repetitions should produce a positive {LSE}. Consistent with prior findings, spaced repetitions always produced a positive {LSE}, but increases in depth of processing, study time, and massed repetitions did not. A model implements the one-shot hypothesis, and a role for context storage as a link between episodic and semantic memory is discussed.},

This paper investigates, by means of micro-simulation, the feasibility of a circular {PRT}-system that connects the campus of the Technical University Eindhoven with the main railway station. The features of the applied simulation tool are described, as well as the performance indicators used. For two alternative boarding concepts the planned {PRT}-system is analyzed. The analysis shows the impact of the different concepts on the quality and efficiency of the system. Conclusion is that there is a trade-off between user quality (expressed as average waiting time at stops) and the system efficiency.},

The reactivation theory assumes that the activation decay of memory within spaces leads to increased reactivation at succeeding presentation, which causes the spacing effect. In Experiment 1, reactivation was measured using a repetition priming paradigm to find that the space with the greatest reactivation expanded as presentation times increased. Experiment 2 showed that no other condition yielded a spacing effect greater than the expanding spaced learning schedule with the greatest reactivation at each presentation. It was also suggested that the expansion of the space with the greatest reactivation was not caused by increase in presentation time but by the previous reactivation. In Experiment 3, the above possibility was confirmed through a repetition priming paradigm. All of these results not only supported the reactivation theory but also gave us a foundation on which to construct a more effective spaced learning schedule.},

    abstract = {Personal rapid transit ({PRT}) uses small driverless vehicles operating on dedicated guideways to transport passengers efficiently to their destinations. A study was focused on the safety and security of {PRT} in a university setting. Safety issues result from accidental causes, and security issues result from deliberate causes, but the effects are similar; both were analyzed according to threats (or hazards) and vulnerabilities. Threats and vulnerabilities were rated according to {ASCE}'s automated people mover standards. Safety data were gathered for the 30-year old Morgantown {PRT} system at West Virginia University and for surface transportation on the Kansas State University ({KSU}) campus. {KSU} has no plans to build a {PRT} system. Where applicable, these data were used to calibrate the hypothetical {PRT} system ratings and also used to help determine which of those aspects rated undesirable or, worse, warranted additional mitigating measures. The study concluded that no aspect of {PRT} posed any significant security or safety issues that had not been successfully mitigated in other forms of public transit. Furthermore, the nature of {PRT}, in which passengers are aggregated in small groups rather than large groups, provides significant threat deterrence when compared with traditional transit. In addition, using a {PRT} concept as a shuttle between peripheral parking and central facilities in combination with restricted vehicle access to central facilities significantly decreases the threat exposure for vehicle-born explosive devices.},

As this development process has evolved, it has become increasingly evident that a marketable system will soon be available for deployment in many locales throughout the world. Although many of us have heard and read about {PRT} systems, no one has ever built one for revenue or non-revenue service. Consequently, a considerable amount of speculation exists as to the viability of such a system in todays transit world. {PRT} systems must have a distinct advantage over other forms of transportation in order to make it attractive and be able to be implemented in an environment which is primarily hostile to anything which violates the suburban landscape. In order to achieve these objectives, a {PRT} system must be flexible, fast, and most importantly, economical to operate. In addition, a {PRT} system must be able to achieve integration into a community in the least obtrusive manner possible and, at the same time, serve its ridership base conveniently. This abstract will look at one form of use for a {PRT} system. That use will be to serve as an intermodal link between one alternative form of transportation in the suburbs. This paper will address the following: Alignment Stations Maintenance Yard Ridership Fare Management The {PRT} system depicted is a fictional alignment which could be located in any number of suburban locales acid does not reflect any long range planning concept. Stations will also be discussed; as to how these stations will be handled to fit into the community yet situated to handle the anticipated ridership as well. The paper will address how the needs of the system are to be met and the facilities required to serve this system. Ultimately, the success of {PRT} will be judged by its ability to attract sustainable ridership as well as recover {O\&M} expenditures through the farebox. To that end, this paper will examine ridership potential and fare management strategies afforded by this technology.},

    abstract = {In this paper we develop optimal dispatching controllers for elevator systems during uppeak traffic, An uppeak traffic period arises when the bulk of the passenger traffic is moving from the first floor up into the building (e.g., the start of a business day in an office building). The cars deliver the passengers and then return empty to the first door to pick up more passengers. We show that the structure of the optimal dispatching policy minimizing the discounted or average passenger waiting time is a threshold-based policy, That is, the optimal policy is to dispatch an available car from the first floor when the number of passengers inside the car reaches or exceeds a threshold that depends on several factors including the passenger arrival rate, elevator performance capabilities, and the number of elevators available at the first door. Since most elevator systems have sensors to determine the car locations and the number of passengers in each car, such a threshold policy is easily implemented, Our analysis is based on a Markov decision problem formulation with a batch service queueing model consisting of a single queue served by multiple finite-capacity bulk servers, We use dynamic programming techniques to obtain the structure of the optimal control policy and to derive some of its important properties, Several numerical examples are included to illustrate our results and to compare the optimal threshold policy to some known ad hoc approaches, Finally, since many transportation systems can be modeled as multiserver batch service queueing systems, we expect our results to be useful in controlling those systems as well.},

The design of this controller is motivated by our previous paper where we proved that for a queuing model of the uppeak dispatching problem a threshold policy is optimal (in the sense of minimizing the average passenger waiting time) with threshold parameters that depend on the passenger arrival rate. The controller, which we call the concurrent estimation dispatching algorithm ({CEDA}), uses concurrent estimation techniques for discrete-event systems. The {CEDA} allows us to observe the elevator system while it operates under some arbitrary thresholds, and concurrently estimate, in an unobtrusive way, what the waiting time would have been had the system operated under a set of different thresholds. These concurrently estimated waiting times are used to adapt the operating thresholds to match the elevator service rate to a changing passenger arrival rate. Implementation issues relating to the limited state information provided by actual elevator systems are resolved in a way that maintains modest computational requirements and avoids the need for supplemental sensors beyond those already typically provided. Numerical performance results show the advantages of the {CEDA} over currently used dispatching algorithms for uppeak.},

@article{Rodier1998Evaluation,
    abstract = {Various combinations of advanced public transportation systems ({APTS}), including advanced transit information, demand responsive transit, and personal rapid transit, are evaluated by applying traditional travel and emissions criteria as well as consumer welfare and equity criteria. A state-of-the-practice regional travel demand model is used to simulate the travel effects of the {APTS} technologies in the Sacramento region for the year 2015. A method of obtaining consumer welfare is applied to the mode choice models in the travel model. It was found that {APTS} technologies, which were simulated in this study to act as feeder service for light rail and bus transit, did not significantly reduce congestion and emissions in the region. This was primarily because the Sacramento region lacks extensive penetration by light rail and bus service. The consumer welfare evaluation, however, showed that all the {APTS} technology scenarios yielded an economic benefit and were generally equitable even when capital, operation, and maintenance costs were included in the analysis. Further, the analysis showed that advanced transit information service alone produced the greatest increase in consumer welfare. The total yearly difference in benefits among the scenarios would be significant. Thus, it is concluded that the method of obtaining consumer welfare used in this study is a useful analytical tool for identifying optimal bundles of {APTS} technologies.

    abstract = {Modern elevator systems in high-rise buildings consist of groups of elevators with centralized control. The goal in elevator planning is to configure a suitable elevator group to be built. The elevator group must satisfy specific minimum requirements for a number of standard performance criteria. In addition, it is desirable to optimize the configuration in terms of other criteria related to the performance, economy and service level of the elevator group. Different stakeholders involved in the planning phase emphasize different criteria. Most of the criteria measurements are by nature uncertain. Some criteria can be estimated by using analytical models, while others, especially those related to the service level in different traffic patterns, require simulations. In this paper we formulate the elevator planning problem as a stochastic discrete multicriteria decision-making problem. We compare 10 feasible elevator group configurations for a 20-floor building. We evaluate the criteria related to the service level in different traffic situations using the {KONE} Building Traffic Simulator, and use analytical models and expert judgments for other criteria. The resulting decision problem contains mixed type criteria. Some criteria are represented by the multivariate Gaussian distribution, others by deterministic values and ordinal (ranking) information. To identify configurations that can best satisfy the goals of the stakeholders, we analyze the problem using the stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis ({SMAA}) method.

@article{Tolliver2006Trip,
    abstract = {Large grain elevators are major sources of truck traffic in many areas. Shuttle trains, a recent railroad innovation, have further concentrated truck deliveries at larger elevators. These facilities-which have not been analyzed in previous trip generation studies-pose issues such as large truck access and pavement design. In this paper, elevator trip generation equations are estimated from detailed facility, land use, and highway traffic data in North Dakota. A trip attraction equation is used to explain the effects of elevator storage capacity and side track capacity on elevator throughput. Elevators are classified on the basis of track capacity as shuttle train, unit train, and multicar. Shuttle-train elevators typically consign 110-car trains, while unit-train elevators consign 50- to 100-car trains. The analysis shows that large shuttle-train elevators may generate 35,000 to 40,000 loaded and empty truck trips per year. A large unit-train elevator may generate 20,000 annual trips. The trucks are usually a mixture of combination five-axle and single-unit trucks. On average, each truck generates 1.04 equivalent single-axle loads on flexible pavements. Thus, a large facility may generate much of the traffic load experienced by pavements in the area. Moreover, truck deliveries to elevators exhibit seasonal variation. Approximately 15\\ of the annual volume is delivered during the peak month. Thus, a large shuttle facility may generate 225 trucks per day during the peak harvest month.},

By developing a set of rules for the vehicles to follow, the various parts of a Bayesian Network ({BN}), its nodes, parameters, structure and utility function are determined. The variables in the network are generated from the sensor data of the {PRT} vehicles. Using the overall system goals, a utility function can be devised that will select the best action for an agent to take. Simulation results show that this methodology is useful for "rapid prototyping" a decision theoretic agent. The gap between the intelligent agent and rule based agent performance for the collision metrics suggests that more research is needed to develop a systematic method of creating utility functions to meet system goals.},

    abstract = {Repeated exposure to objects improves our ability to identify and name them, even after a long delay. Previous brain imaging studies have demonstrated that this experience-related. facilitation of object naming is associated with neural changes in distinct brain regions. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) to examine the modulation of neural activity in the object naming system as a function of experience and time. Pictures of common objects were presented repeatedly for naming at different time intervals (1 h, 6 h and 3 days) before scanning, or at 30 s intervals during scanning. The results revealed that as objects became more familiar with experience, activity in occipitotemporal and left inferior frontal regions decreased while activity in the left insula and basal ganglia increased. In posterior regions, reductions in activity as a result of multiple repetitions did not interact with time, whereas in left inferior frontal cortex larger decreases were observed when repetitions were spaced out over time. This differential modulation of activity in distinct brain regions provides support for the idea that long-lasting object priming is mediated by two neural mechanisms. The first mechanism may involve changes in object-specific representations in occipitotemporal cortices, the second may be a form of procedural learning involving a reorganization in brain circuitry that leads to more efficient name retrieval.},

The pilot was part of an innovation process to lead to a more sustainable urban transport system. The guidelines of the bureau for sustainable technological development were followed to guarantee the long-term feasibility and effectiveness of the process. Although the process was designed carefully with concern for the predictable risks, the pilot had to be stopped because of unforeseen political problems. A change of policy priorities and key people caused the project's failure. In addition, strict regulations for tendering bids slowed the process and favored bidders without project knowledge. This paper analyzes the different risk factors and gives conclusions for improving chances for success in future similar innovation projects.

In contrast, with mixed lists spacing effects emerged at both short spacing intervals and long spacing intervals (Experiment 3). Additional analyses on the combined pure-list data revealed that the correlation between the primacy advantage and the spacing effect in Quadrants 2 through 4 was positive for all-massed lists and negative for all-spaced lists. This provides some first evidence for the zero-sum nature of the spacing effect in pure lists. The need to incorporate assumptions about rehearsal in theories of spacing is discussed.

The speeds of vehicles are controlled to be constant, and the distance between vehicles is also strictly controlled to be only 12 m at 40 km/h. Thus, the vehicle density of the {PRT} system is much higher than that of the mass railway train ({MRT}) system. Moreover, the required power of a {PRT} vehicle is much smaller than that of an {MRT} vehicle. Therefore, the methodology to allocate the position of power supplies for an {MRT} system is thought to be improper for a {PRT} system. This paper proposes a practical method that locates power supplies optimally for a {PRT} system to achieve a load power balance and a total power loss minimization. This method uses an iterative approach based on a new virtual isolation concept among power supplies.

@article{Yoder2000Capital,
    abstract = {Preparing capital cost estimates for new transit technologies requires refining and refitting traditional estimation tools. The personal rapid transit ({PRT}) system project in Rosemont Illinois-a suburb of Chicago near {O'Hare} International Airport-required (1) the development of estimates of {PRT} capital costs, (2) establishment of a reasonable cost range for the {PRT} system, and (3) an order-of-magnitude evaluation of existing cost projections. A method was developed to compare {PRT} system components (versus the entire system) with the components of existing automated-guideway transit ({AGT}) and automated people mover ({APM}) systems in North America. Seven components of the {PRT}, {AGT} and {APM} systems were examined-(1) guideways; (2) stations; (3) maintenance and control facilities; (4) power and utility systems; (5) vehicles; (6) command, control, and communications systems; and (7) engineering and project management. Three analysis techniques were used(1) statistically significant regression analysis; (2) measurement of a central tendency for "comparable" systems; and (3) statistics from all {AGT} systems. The results show that the combination of the three techniques worked well for component-level studies and show promise for use in other cost analyses involving new technologies or application of existing technologies on a scale outside the bounds of previous experience. In addition to the cost study, a {PRT} ridership forecasting approach and projections were evaluated, providing another key element of decision support for potential {PRT} deployment in Rosemont.},

@article{Young2004Automated,
    abstract = {A system to transport people into and about closely spaced activity centers continues to be an unmet need in the {U.S}. transportation infrastructure. New automated people movers, particularly personal rapid transit ({PRT}) concepts, hold tremendous potential to solve many of the mobility issues surrounding activity centers. Even as these concepts move steadily toward initial deployment, analysis tools and methodologies are lacking to compare existing mobility practice objectively with predicted practice with one of these new systems in place. Existing simulation tools are primarily limited to a single mode of transportation. Traditional ridership forecasting is mainly based on socioeconomic factors so that captive ridership can be estimated. A methodology for comparing the before-and-after effects of a proposed new transit system is introduced. The network model is multimodall and incorporates vehicle, pedestrian, and transit networks and their interconnections (e.g., parking lots). Mode choice is determined simply from minimum travel time. The modeling concepts are described and applied to a midwestern university campus to evaluate the potential impact of a {PRT} system. Measures of system effectiveness are extracted from the model results, not just simple statistics of ridership for a particular mode of transport.},

@article{Zhang2005Practical,
    abstract = {Leaky coaxial cables have found applications in the creation of network infrastructures for mobile and personal communication services in underground and enclosed spaces. A digital cellular system based on the {GSM} 900 standard and using radiated mode leaky coaxial cables has been implemented in an underground mass rapid transit environment. This paper presents the practical performance evaluation of the system. First, we start with a brief introduction of a radiated mode leaky coaxial cable and the digital cellular system {GSM} 900, and then we move into a full description of the measurement campaign; next we focus on an analysis of the measured performance data about received signal level, received signal quality, speech quality index and grade of service. The results show that the system performance is generally good; however, the poor system performance often occurs at the terminals of the leaky coaxial cable. In addition, it is found that the system performance is highly correlated with the density of train passenger. The higher train passenger density degrades the system performance.

Our system allows the grammar to be specified as a separate class or mixin, independent of tools that rely upon it such as parsers, syntax colorizers etc. Thus, our grammars serve as a shared executable specification for a variety of language processing tools. This motivates our use of the term executable grammar. We discuss the language features that enable these pleasing results, and, in contrast, the challenge our library poses for static type systems.},

We provide a simple derivation of the queue length transform for the embedded Markov chain, and present a new computational procedure for finding the moments of the queue length distribution. Extensive computational tests demonstrate that the new procedure is significantly faster and more stable than the standard method, from the literature, that requires solving a set of simultaneous linear equations. We give formulas for the mean and variance of the length of the queue for the general case of compound Poisson arrivals, random batch capacities, general service times and a general control strategy.},

For queues with compound Poisson arrivals, the procedure uses the imbedded Markov chain to study a variety of vehicle dispatching strategies. The technique is easy to implement, numerically stable and, for most problems that arise in transportation, computationally faster than other approaches that have been proposed. For queues with {non-Poisson} arrivals, an iterative scheme is devised for calculating a discretized form of the waiting time distribution using the concept of unfinished work. Numerical experiments with different discretization strategies indicate that a high level of accuracy can be attained at a very moderate cost. 10.1287/trsc.20.2.65},

Job arrivals in different product classes are independent of the arrivals in other classes. The arrivals within each product class and the service times are assumed to have general, independent and identical distributions. Based on approximate analyses, we present an estimate for the mean number of jobs and provide two complementary characterizations of the product departure streams. We present methods to compute the squared coefficient of variation of the departure intervals and the probability distribution of the lot sizes of product departures. The computational results reported in this paper demonstrate that the accuracy of the approximations is acceptable in most applications. Based on these results, we identify conditions under which the estimates can be expected to perform well. The methods developed in this paper complement the decomposition approach for open queueing networks proposed by Shanthikumar and Buzacott (1981) and Whitt (1983) and permit analysis of networks with some types of batch processing.},

@article{Kahraman2008Stochastic,

A critical drawback of an {AGV} is its prohibitively high cost. Cost considerations dictate an economic design of {AGV} systems. This paper presents an analytical model that uses a Markov chain approximation approach to evaluate the performance of the system with respect to costs and the risk associated with it. This model also allows the analytic optimization of the capacity of an {AGV} in a closed-loop multimachine stochastic system. We present numerical results with the Markov chain model which indicate that our model produces results comparable to a simulation model, but does so in a fraction of the computational time needed by the latter. This advantage of the analytical model becomes more pronounced in the context of optimization of the {AGV}'s capacity which without an analytical approach would require numerous simulation runs at each point in the capacity space. </para>},

Relationships between the moments of the waiting time and queue length distributions are developed without further use of transforms, resulting in an exact expression for the expected waiting time and an approximation for the variance. A simple approach for calculating the roots of a particular function, needed to find the moments of the queue length distribution, is presented and used to demonstrate that this task can be accomplished very easily.

Since most modern networks operate on the basis of time slotting, and transmit information in fixed length (packets or cells), it thus becomes natural to model such networks in discrete-time by associating a time slot in a physical network with the unit time in the corresponding discrete-time model. The book shows how, in this way, very accurate models that faithfully reproduce the stochastic behaviour of a communication or computer network can be constructed. <p> The treatment is self contained, and progresses from basic probability theory and discrete-time queueing networks. These latter are applied to model the performance of numerous wide area satellite networks and local area networks, ranging in complexity from simple Aloha schemes to the timed token protocol of the {FDDI} network. The main objective of this book is to present a unified method for modeling any network access protocol as a discrete-time queueing network and t develop efficient solution techniques for these models. A significant number of the models and their solutions which are included have not previously appeared in the open literature. <p> The text should prove useful to practitioners and researchers concerned with communication and computer network performance modeling, or anyone wanting a sound understanding of the application of discrete-time technique to this subject area.},

@article{Papadaki2003Adaptive,
    abstract = {We address the problem of dispatching a vehicle with different product classes. There is a common dispatch cost, but holding costs that vary by product class. The problem exhibits multidimensional state, outcome and action spaces, and as a result is computationally intractable using either discrete dynamic programming methods, or even as a deterministic integer program. We prove a key structural property for the decision function, and exploit this property in the development of continuous value function approximations that form the basis of an approximate dispatch rule. Comparisons on single product-class problems, where optimal solutions are available, demonstrate solutions that are within a few percent of optimal. The algorithm is then applied to a problem with 100 product classes, and comparisons against a carefully tuned myopic heuristic demonstrate significant improvements. {\\copyright} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

@article{Massey1996Estimating,
    abstract = {Motivated by telecommunication applications, we investigate ways to estimate the parameters of a nonhomogeneous Poisson process with linear rate over a finite interval, based on the number of counts in measurement subintervals. Such a linear arrival-rate function can serve as a component of a piecewise-linear approximation to a general arrival-rate function. We consider ordinary least squares ({OLS}), iterative weighted least squares ({IWLS}) and maximum likelihood ({ML}), all constrained to yield a nonnegative rate function. We prove that {ML} coincides with {IWLS}. As a reference point, we also consider the theoretically optimal weighted least squares ({TWLS}), which is least squares with weights inversely proportional to the variances (which would not be known with data). Overall, {ML} performs almost as well as {TWLS}. We describe computer simulations conducted to evaluate these estimation procedures. None of the procedures differ greatly when the rate function is not near 0 at either end, but when the rate function is near 0 at one end, {TWLS} and {ML} are significantly more effective than {OLS}. The number of measurement subintervals (with fixed total interval) makes surprisingly little difference when the rate function is not near 0 at either end. The variances are higher with only two or three subintervals, but there usually is little benefit from going above ten. In contrast, more measurement intervals help {TWLS} and {ML} when the rate function is near 0 at one end. We derive explicit formulas for the {OLS} variances and the asymptotic {TWLS} variances (as the number of measurement intervals increases), assuming the nonnegativity constraints are not violated. These formulas reveal the statistical precision of the estimators and the influence of the parameters and the method. Knowing how the variance depends on the interval length can help determine how to approximate general arrival-rate functions by piecewise-linear ones. We also develop statistical tests to determine whether the linear Poisson model is appropriate.},

In this case, inversion is efficient while being highly compatible with correlation induction variance reduction methods.

Conceptually, auction algorithms represent a significant departure from the cost improvement idea that underlies primal simplex and dual ascent methods; at any one iteration, they may deteriorate both the primal and the dual cost. Auction algorithms perform very well for several important types of problems, both in theory and in practice, and they are also well suited for parallel computation.},

Propulsion units cooperate using a communication network with a topology identical to that of the guideway network, eliminating the need for explicit knowledge of global topography and enabling rapid real-time response to service requests using a parallel, shortest-route algorithm. The concepts developed are applied to a high-performance system in which vehicles respond to spontaneous requests to transfer material from point to point in manufacturing facilities in seconds rather than the minutes required in conventional {AGV} and conveyor systems. In this application, the vehicle and propulsion-unit lengths are on the same order of magnitude, the propulsion-unit-length/maximum-vehicle-velocity time characteristic is small, and the ratio of the number of propulsion units to the number of vehicles is large},

    abstract = {Merge junctions and intersections are the principal capacity limiters and sources of delay in automated guideway transit ({AGT}) networks. The capacity and delay performance of the merge junctions must be thoroughly understood before an {AGT} network can be designed. This paper describes the modeling and event-structured Monte Carlo simulation of a single merge junction, having two input lanes and one output lane, operating in a quasi-synchronous network. The simulation described here differs from previous merging models by permitting slots to be of variable length to accommodate trains of different lengths, and allowing unlimited maneuvering of trains (if needed). It has the unique ability to represent the operation of a special, newly devised concatenating merge, which permits trains arriving on separate input lanes to combine themselves into a longer train at the merge. The simulation logic which is used to represent special features of merge performance (flow compressibility, upstream propagation of disturbances, etc.) is explained, and the implementation using {GASP} {IIA} is described. The statistical considerations underlying the experimental design are discussed and some sample diagnostic outputs displayed.},

    abstract = {{AVCS} maglev, which is the synergistic combination of Advanced Vehicle Control Systems and high-speed magnetic levitation technology, would operate on ordinary highways and streets under manual control as well as on instrumented highways (magways) under automatic control. In this paper the important aspects of fully-automated highway network operation of {AVCS} maglev are investigated, which include mainline longitudinal control, entrance ramp control, speed transition control and peak-period optimization strategy. To select a suitable longitudinal control alternative, block control, vehicle-follower control and point-follower control concepts are investigated. To find an entrance ramp operation strategy, the average delay of a ramp vehicle in position to be merged, the ramp capacities and the ramp queue lengths are calculated. The magway is envisaged to consist of three types of sections - restricted capacity section ({RCS}), speed transition section ({STS}) and unrestricted capacity section ({UCS}). The speed transition section is always located between {UCS} and {RCS} to adjust the speeds between these two types of sections. During the speed transition operation it is crucial to ensure stability within the platoon of vehicles operating with small spacings. For this purpose a suitable vehicle-following model is investigated. Lastly, the peak-period optimization strategy to maximize the throughput of a magway system is investigated using a linear programming model.},

Tools from algebraic graph theory prove useful in modeling the communication network and relating its topology to formation stability. We prove a Nyquist criterion that uses the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian matrix to determine the effect of the communication topology on formation stability. We also propose a method for decentralized information exchange between vehicles. This approach realizes a dynamical system that supplies each vehicle with a common reference to be used for cooperative motion. We prove a separation principle that decomposes formation stability into two components: Stability of this is achieved information flow for the given graph and stability of an individual vehicle for the given controller. The information flow can thus be rendered highly robust to changes in the graph, enabling tight formation control despite limitations in intervehicle communication capability.},

In both lines, the same upper bound is set for the length of forward and backward maneuvering. When the maneuver length is likely to exceed this upper bound, the vehicle is forced to diverge even if it was to go straight, so that the maneuver length does not exceed the upper {bound.To} analyze the behavior of this model from the probability theoretical viewpoint, the state is defined based on the maneuver length of vehicles at each time instance synchronous to cell arrival. Thus, the model is formulated as a finite Markov chain (one-dimensional random walk). As a result, the relation between vehicle traffic density and (1) delay distribution and expected delay time due to intersection passing, (2) abort rate, and (3) throughput, is obtained explicitly.},

@article{Secomandi2000Comparing,
    abstract = {The paper considers a version of the vehicle routing problem where customers' demands are uncertain. The focus is on dynamically routing a single vehicle to serve the demands of a known set of geographically dispersed customers during real-time operations. The goal consists of minimizing the expected distance traveled in order to serve all customers' demands. Since actual demand is revealed upon arrival of the vehicle at the location of each customer, fully exploiting this feature requires a dynamic approach. This work studies the suitability of the emerging field of neuro-dynamic programming ({NDP}) in providing approximate solutions to this difficult stochastic combinatorial optimization problem. The paper compares the performance of two {NDP} algorithms: optimistic approximate policy iteration and a rollout policy. While the former improves the performance of a nearest-neighbor policy by 2.3\%, the computational results indicate that the rollout policy generates higher quality solutions. The implication for the practitioner is that the rollout policy is a promising candidate for vehicle routing applications where a dynamic approach is required. Recent years have seen a growing interest in the development of vehicle routing algorithms to cope with the uncertain and dynamic situations found in real-world applications (see the recent survey paper by Powell et al. [ 1 ]). As noted by Psaraftis [ 2 ], dramatic advances in information and communication technologies provide new possibilities and opportunities for vehicle routing research and applications. The enhanced capability of capturing the information that becomes available during real-time operations opens up new research directions. This informational availability provides the possibility of developing dynamic routing algorithms that take advantage of the information that is dynamically revealed during operations. Exploiting such information presents a significant challenge to the operations research/management science community. The single vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands [ 3 ] provides an example of a simple, yet very difficult to solve exactly, dynamic vehicle routing problem [2, p. 157]. The problem can be formulated as a stochastic shortest path problem [ 4 ] characterized by an enormous number of states. Neuro-dynamic programming [ 5 and 6 ] is a recent methodology that can be used to approximately solve very large and complex stochastic decision and control problems. In this spirit, this paper is meant to study the applicability of neuro-dynamic programming algorithms to the single-vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands.},

Further, we improve significantly the best known lower bounds for this class of problems and construct policies that are provably within a small constant factor relative to the optimal solution. We show that the leading behavior of the optimal system time has a particularly simple from that offers important structural insight into the behavior of the system. Moreover, by distinguishing two classes of policies our analysis shows an interesting dependence of the system performance on the demand distribution.},

@article{Papastavrou1996Stochastic,
    abstract = {A stochastic and dynamic vehicle routing problem called the Dynamic Traveling Repairman Problem ({DTRP}) was introduced by Bertsimas and van Ryzin. Several routing policies were analyzed in light traffic and in heavy traffic conditions. But, the good light traffic policies become very quickly unstable with increasing traffic intensity, and the good heavy traffic policies are inefficient in light traffic conditions. In this paper, a new routing policy is defined and analyzed, using results from branching processes with state dependent immigration. This policy not only performs optimally in light traffic, but also performs very well in heavy traffic. This is important to the designer of a service system because the traffic conditions may be variable and/or be unpredictable, and having to switch routing policies could prove to be costly and difficult to implement.},

    abstract = {In this paper a stochastic and dynamic model for the Pick-up and Delivery Problem is developed and analyzed. Demands for service arrive according to a Poisson process in time. The pick-up locations of the demands are independent and uniformly distributed over a service region. A single vehicle must transport the demands from the pick-up to the delivery location. Once a demand has been picked up it can only be dropped off at its desired delivery location. The delivery locations are independent and uniformly distributed over the region, and they are independent of the pick-up locations. The objective is to minimize the expected time in the system for the demands. Unit-capacity vehicle and multiple-capacity vehicle variations are considered. For each variation, bounds on the performance of the routing policies are derived for light and heavy traffic. The policies are analyzed using both analytical methods and simulation.},

@article{Fleischmann2004Dynamic,
    abstract = {With the increasing availability of real-time information and communication systems in logistics, the need for appropriate planning algorithms, which make use of this technology, arises. Customers in transport markets increasingly expect quicker and more flexible fulfillment of their orders, especially in the electronic marketplace. This paper considers a dynamic routing system that dispatches a fleet of vehicles according to customer orders arriving at random during the planning period. Each customer order requires a transport from a pickup location to a delivery location in a given time window. The system disposes of online communication with all drivers and customers and, in addition, disposes of online information on travel times from a traffic management center. This paper presents a planning framework for this situation which, to our knowledge, has not yet been addressed in the literature. It then describes three routing procedures for event-based dispatching, which differ in the length of the planning horizon per event. We focus on the use of dynamic travel time information, which requires dynamic shortest path calculations. The procedures are tested and compared using real-life data of an urban traffic management center and a logistics service provider.},

In this context, assigning and scheduling vehicle routes is a crucial management problem. In this paper, a vehicle routing problem with dynamic travel times due to potential traffic congestion is considered. The approach developed introduces mainly the traffic congestion component based on queueing theory. This is an innovative modeling scheme to capture travel times. The queueing approach is compared with other approaches and its potential benefits are described and quantified. Moreover, the optimization of the starting times of a route at the distribution center is evaluated. Finally, the trade-off between solution quality and calculation time is discussed. Numerous test instances are used, both to illustrate the appropriateness of the approach as well as to show that time-independent solutions are often unrealistic within a congested traffic environment, which is usually the case on European road networks.},

The implementation of {GPS} technology has radically changed the traditional approach to taxi fleet management. In comparison to the radio-paging systems used previously, the satellite-based dispatch systems have considerably enhanced the accuracy, communications, and productivity of taxi operations. However, variables associated with human-system interfaces and operational environments should be taken into account in order to achieve the full capacity of the systems. Furthermore, the reengineering of operations and the training of end-users are vital to the improvement of service quality and the development of sophisticated public transport systems},

@article{Gans1999Dynamic,
    abstract = {We analyze a general model of dynamic vehicle dispatching systems in which congestion is the primary measure of performance. In the model, a finite collection of tours are dynamically dispatched to deliver loads that arrive randomly over time. A load waits in queue until it is assigned to a tour. This representation, which is analogous to classical set-covering models, can be used to study a variety of dynamic routing and load consolidation problems. We characterize the optimal work in the system in heavy traffic using a lower bound from our earlier work (Gans and van Ryzin 1997) and an upper bound which is based on a simple batching policy. These results give considerable insight into how various parameters of the problem affect system congestion. In addition, our analysis suggests a practical heuristic which, in simulation experiments, significantly outperforms more conventional dispatching policies. The heuristic uses a few simple principles to control congestion, principles which can be easily incorporated within classical, static routing algorithms.},

Each retailer faces a constant, retailer specific, demand rate and inventory holding cost is charged at the retailers and the warehouses. We show that, in an effective strategy which minimizes the asymptotic long run average cost, each warehouse receives fully loaded trucks from the vendor but never holds inventory. That is, each warehouse serves only as a coordinator of the frequency, time and sizes of deliveries to the retailers. This insight is used to construct an inventory control policy and vehicle routing strategy for multi-echelon distribution systems. Computational results are also reported.},

Refined petroleum products valued at several billion dollars per year are dispatched from more than 80 bulk terminals on a fleet exceeding 300 vehicles in approximately 2600 loads per day. Centralized use of the dispatch system required its design and implementation as a set of transaction modules within a large management information system. This environment presents special challenges for the optimization methods; an heuristic sequential network assignment was developed for certified performance on these dispatch models in lieu of their solution as integer programs. Objectives include minimizing transportation costs (approaching \\$100 million annually) while maintaining equitable man and equipment workload distribution, safety standards, and customer service, and satisfying equipment compatibility restrictions.},

We describe the problem and identify its basic structure and main characteristics. We then introduce two dynamic deterministic formulations for the single and multicommodity cases, which offer a general modeling framework for this class of problems, and which account for its specific characteristics: the space and time dependency of events, substitutions among container types, relationships with partner companies, imports and exports, massive equilibration flows, etc. Finally, we provide a mathematical formulation for handling, in the single commodity case, the uncertainty of demand and supply data that is characteristic of container allocation and distribution problems. Various modeling choices, data requirements, and algorithmic considerations related to the implementation of the models are also discussed.},

@article{Sahinidis2004Optimization,
    abstract = {A large number of problems in production planning and scheduling, location, transportation, finance, and engineering design require that decisions be made in the presence of uncertainty. Uncertainty, for instance, governs the prices of fuels, the availability of electricity, and the demand for chemicals. A key difficulty in optimization under uncertainty is in dealing with an uncertainty space that is huge and frequently leads to very large-scale optimization models. Decision-making under uncertainty is often further complicated by the presence of integer decision variables to model logical and other discrete decisions in a multi-period or multi-stage setting. This paper reviews theory and methodology that have been developed to cope with the complexity of optimization problems under uncertainty. We discuss and contrast the classical recourse-based stochastic programming, robust stochastic programming, probabilistic (chance-constraint) programming, fuzzy programming, and stochastic dynamic programming. The advantages and shortcomings of these models are reviewed and illustrated through examples. Applications and the state-of-the-art in computations are also reviewed. Finally, we discuss several main areas for future development in this field. These include development of polynomial-time approximation schemes for multi-stage stochastic programs and the application of global optimization algorithms to two-stage and chance-constraint formulations.},

@article{Koh2005Scheduling,
    abstract = {Motivated by a bottleneck operation in a multi-layer ceramic capacitor production line, we study a scheduling problem of batch processing machine in which a number of jobs are processed simultaneously as a batch. The performance measures considered include makespan, total completion time, and total weighted completion time. We first present a new simple integer programming formulation for the problem, and using this formulation, one can easily find optimal solutions for small problems. However, since the problem is {NP}-hard and the size of a real problem is very large, we propose a number of heuristic algorithms and design a hybrid genetic algorithm to solve practical big-size problems in a reasonable computational time. To verify performance of the algorithms, we compare them with lower bounds for the problems. From the results of these computational experiments the heuristic algorithms including the genetic algorithm show different performances for the three problems.},

The passengers arrive at each terminal according to a compound Poisson process and the travel time from one terminal to the other is a random variable following an arbitrary distribution. The following control limit policy is considered: dispatch the shuttle at terminali, at the instant that the total number of passengers waiting at terminali reaches or exceeds a predetermined control limitm i . The objective of this paper is to obtain the mean waiting time of an arbitrary passenger at each terminal for given control valuesm 1 andm 2.

This challenging problem affects both travellers (reliability of service) as well as operators (productivity and efficiency of resources utilization). The potential of new information and communication technologies and existing hardware possibilities offer great opportunities for the development of effective and flexible management and control tools for public transport. In this paper the simulation decision-support tool for dynamic optimal dispatching control purposes have been developed, with the use of the {SIMULINK} package with Toolboxes. The following optimal dispatching control problems have been solved: punctuality control (which compensates deviations from schedule), regularity control (which compensates deviations from regular headway) and synchronizing control with linear ({LQ}, dead-beat) feedback and control and system state constraints; {LQG} stochastic control with real-time estimation of the model parameters; and bus route zone control for synchronising passenger transfers or the operation of different lines on common segments of the route. The results presented are illustrated by 15 numerical examples.},

Combined with other technologies, such as automated passenger counting and wireless communication, it is now feasible for these operators to execute a variety of real-time strategies for coordinating the movement of buses along their routes. This paper compares control strategies that depend on technologies for communication, tracking and passenger counting, to those that depend solely on local information (e.g., time that a bus arrived at a stop, and whether other connecting buses have also arrived). We also develop methods to forecast bus arrival times, which are most accurate for lines with long headways, as is usually the case in timed transfer systems. These methods are tested in simulations, which demonstrate that technology is most advantageous when the schedule slack is close to zero, when the headway is large, and when there are many connecting buses.},

Examples may be found in the theory of queues, inventories, and other stochastic service and storage systems.

The expression is in terms of the sojourn measure W associated with { Y ( t ), t 0}: W { A } = E {time spent in A by Y ( t ), 0 ≤ t < ∞}. The results are applied to compound input processes and processes with stationary independent increments.

We also study a generalization of a clearing system in which the clearing operation restores the net quantity to a level m, which may be different from zero. Applications to bulk-service queues, demand-responsive public-service systems, and (s, S) inventory systems, among others, are discussed. The exact solutions that we obtain for the optimal clearing parameters are compared to those implied by deterministic approximations.},

@article{Gaver1997Testing,
    abstract = {A new piece of equipment has been purchased in a lot of size m. Some of the items can be used in destructive testing before the item is put into use. Testing uncovers faults which can be removed from the remaining pieces of equipment in the lot. If t \&lt; m pieces of equipment are tested, then those that remain, m1 = m - t, have reduced fault incidence and are more reliable than initially, but m1 may be too small to be useful, or than is desirable. In this paper models are studied to address this question: given the lot size m, how to optimize by choice of t the effectiveness of the pieces of equipment remaining after the test. The models used are simplistic and illustrative; they can be straightforwardly improved. {\\copyright} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Naval Research Logistics 44: 623-637, 1997},

In search of other discrete-time finite-dimensional filters, this paper derives filters for general linear exponential state-space models, of which the Kalman filter is a special case. One particularly interesting model for which a finite-dimensional filter is found to exist is a doubly stochastic discrete-time Poisson process whose rate evolves as the square of the state of a linear Gaussian dynamical system. Such a model has wide applications in communications systems and queueing theory. Another filter, also with applications in communications systems, is derived for estimating the arrival times of a Poisson process based on negative exponentially delayed observations.

The spatial point pattern is observed in a bounded region, which, for most applications, is taken to be a rectangle in the space where the process is defined. The method is based on modeling a density function, defined on this bounded region, that is directly related with the intensity function of the Poisson process. We develop a flexible nonparametric mixture model for this density using a bivariate Beta distribution for the mixture kernel and a Dirichlet process prior for the mixing distribution. Using posterior simulation methods, we obtain full inference for the intensity function and any other functional of the process that might be of interest. We discuss applications to problems where inference for clustering in the spatial point pattern is of interest. Moreover, we consider applications of the methodology to extreme value analysis problems. We illustrate the modeling approach with three previously published data sets. Two of the data sets are from forestry and consist of locations of trees. The third data set consists of extremes from the Dow Jones index over a period of 1303 days.},

There were three objectives, the first was to consider alternative ways of modelling traffic streams approaching the shuttle system, the second to develop a simulation model using various parameters to help explain the behaviour of shuttle systems and the third was to conduct sensitivity studies to observe how such a system responds to changes in model parameters. A ferry system in operation was chosen as an example and a simulation model was developed using {GPSS}. Transient and stationary behaviour patterns of the system were examined under various inputs and constraints. The effect of imbalance in the incoming traffic streams of both sides of the channel was investigated using various combinations of intensity parameters. Service contour lines were derived to determine the efficiency of the system. Non-stationary Weibull and stationary exponential models were used to simulate the incoming traffic streams and the results compared against actual data. It was found that, in general, when the comparisons were based on cumulative statistics, the stationary exponential model performed better. However, in the short run, the nonstationary Weibull model gave the better fit.},

Exact and approximate expressions are obtained for the number of carrier trips per unit time and average queue size at each terminal. They are used to show that it is best never to hold the carrier at the slow terminal and not to randomize in the decision process. Further, we show that holding the carrier at the fast terminal sometimes reduces both trip rate and the sum of the average queue sizes.},

Passengers arrive according to independent Poisson processes, and at only one of the terminals can the dispatcher hold the carrier for more passengers. Our objective: to determine dispatching rules that minimize the long-run average of a linear passenger-waiting-time cost and a charge per trip made by the carrier. When complete information about the system state is available, and travel times are not random, we prove that it is best to dispatch the carrier if, and only if, the total number of passengers waiting at both terminals is greater than a cutoff value. To compute this cutoff value, we propose an iterative method and find that we can approximate it quite well by a simple function of system costs and parameters similar to the economic-lot-size formula. We propose a dispatching rule (which may not be optimal) for the case when only the number of passengers waiting at one terminal is known, and we compare its efficiency to that of the optimal rule that uses complete information. We outline extensions to other optimality criteria and to the case of stochastic travel times.},

While centralized trip planners are challenged by assigning clients and hosts in an ad hoc manner, in particular for non-scheduled hosts, we consider the transportation network as a mobile geosensor network of agents that interact locally by short-range communication and heuristic wayfinding strategies.

The system operates in a heuristic manner and resolved a resource allocation problem in real time, related to the Dial a Ride ({DAR}) case. To decrease the complexity of the initial large-scale problem of resource allocation, space and time decomposition is performed. The space decomposition allows us to obtain local, low dimensional resource allocation problems. The time decomposition defines a discrete time optimization problem of resource allocation, which is solved by a central dispatching unit ({CDU}). It performs the resource allocation among the subsystems in accordance with the state imbalance, defined by the different number of unserved requests in the subsystems. The lower layer problems are solved by local dispatching units ({LDU}) which perform optimal vehicle routing and service of requests in real time. Special procedures, suitable for on-line control, are proposed for obtaining the upper layer solutions and for information transfer between the layers. The behaviour of a taxi system is simulated and the positive influence of the upper layer is shown.},

In the past two decades, we have witnessed the development of a vast, growing body of research focused on formulations and solution procedures for the {NDPs}, which deal with the selection of either link improvements or link additions to an existing road network, with given demand from each origin to each destination. The objective is to make an optimal investment decision in order to minimize the total travel cost in the network, while accounting for the route choice behaviour of network users. In this paper, we present a general survey of existing literature in this area, and present some new developments in model formulations. We incorporate the elasticity of travel demand into the {NDP} and seek the economic-based objective function for optimization. We also pose the mixed network design problem involving simultaneous choice of link addition and capacity improvement which is considered more sensible for road networks. In addition, we introduce the network reserve capacity concept for a capacity improvement plan, and raise and clarify some interesting issues relating to {NDP} and Braess's paradoxes. Finally, from the survey and the new proposal made herein, we offer some perspectives on future research.},

@article{Wong2008Modeling,
    abstract = {This paper extends the model of urban taxi services in congested networks to the case of multiple user classes, multiple taxi modes, and customer hierarchical modal choice. There are several classes of customers with different values of time and money, and several modes of taxi services with distinct combinations of service area restrictions and fare levels. The multi-class multi-mode formulation allows the modeling of both mileage-based and congestion-based taxi fare charging mechanisms in a unified framework, and can more realistically model most urban taxi services, which are charged on the basis of both time and distance. The introduction of multiple taxi modes can also be used to model the differentiation between luxury taxis and normal taxis by their respective service areas and customer waiting times. We propose a simultaneous mathematical formulation of two equilibrium sub-problems for the model. One sub-problem is a combined network equilibrium model ({CNEM}) that describes the hierarchical logit mode choice model of occupied taxis and normal traffic, together with the vacant taxi distributions in the network. The other sub-problem is a set of linear and nonlinear equations ({SLNE}), which ensures the satisfaction of the relation between taxi and customer waiting times, the relation between customer demand and taxi supply for each taxi mode, and taxi service time constraints. The {CNEM} can be formulated as a variational inequality program that is solvable by means of a block {Gauss–Seidel} decomposition approach coupled with the method of successive averages. The {SLNE} can be solved by a Newtonian algorithm with a line search. The {CNEM} is formulated as a special case of the general travel demand model so that it is possible to incorporate the taxi model into an existing package as an add-on module, in which the algorithm for the {CNEM} is built in practice. Most of the parameters are observable, given that such a calibrated transport planning model exists. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

The extensions include incorporation of congestion effects, customer demand elasticity, reformulation of the model and development of a new solution algorithm. Instead of the previous characterization of pure taxi movements in a network by a system of nonlinear equations, a two-level model formulation is proposed for taxi movements in congested road networks. The bi-level problem is a combined network equilibrium model that describes simultaneous movements of vacant and occupied taxis as well as normal traffic in a user-optimal manner for given total customer generation from each origin and total customer attraction to each destination. The upper-level problem is a set of linear and nonlinear equations ensuring that the relation between taxi and customer-waiting times and the relation between customer demand and taxi supply are satisfied. The lower-level problem can be solved by the conventional multi-class combined trip distribution and assignment algorithm, whereas the upper-level problem is solved by a Newtonian algorithm with line search. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the proposed model and algorithm and demonstrate the characteristics of the taxi services in congested road networks.},

It is found that the optimum line location is related to the population density and the circumferential access. The optimum headway is found to be that which causes user waiting time cost to equal the operating cost. The simplification of a population density function varying only radially is introduced. A method for determining the optimum number of lines is developed. This number depends upon the ratio of the access cost to the sum of the waiting and operating costs. It is proven that, for optimality, lines should be located in the centers of corridors of uniform width and have equal headways. A fleet size constraint is also introduced for the simplified case. It is proven that for optimality, the fleet is divided equally between lines.},

@article{Horn2002Multimodal,
    abstract = {The {LITRES}-2 modelling system provides a framework for investigating the performance of urban passenger transport systems, with particular attention to demand-responsive transport modes and traveller information technologies. The modes covered include conventional timetabled services (buses, trains etc.), taxis (both single- and multiple-hire), and other demand-responsive services. Tables of estimated aggregate demand are disaggregated so as to produce a stream of fully-articulated travel-requests. Individual requests are resolved as single- or multiple-leg journeys, through the use of request-broking and journey-planning modules that seek to minimise travellers' generalised costs. Journey-legs allocated to demand-responsive modes are handled by a fleet-scheduling module which includes provision for  ” instantaneous” as well as advance-notice bookings, and for contingent situations such as breakdowns and passenger no-shows. The fleet-scheduling and journey-planning modules are designed as embedded control systems and are intended for use in real-time as well as modelling applications. The paper describes the main analytical and procedural components of {LITRES}-2, and assesses some methodological issues arising from experience in recent planning studies. The system appears to be well suited for use in modelling situations where the critical issues are concerned with the supply rather than demand side of transportation activity.},

@article{Lowson2004Idealised,
    abstract = {Results are presented from two idealised models for public transport. Models are evaluated for trips via a corridor and for a network system meeting a uniform trip demand. The network transport model uses a grid-based synchronous system which could serve a whole city with a maximum of one transfer. This model has been proposed by others, but as far as is known no basic results have been published for its operational effectiveness. The analysis has provided a number of mathematical results for this system. The system proposed may have value in its own right, but is introduced to enable the effectiveness of meeting transport demand with transport networks of different density to be calibrated. An interesting result, which may be new, is that the average trip length for uniform demand in a grid-based city is equal to one sixth of the city perimeter served, independent of grid density. The results for the linear and network cases were found to be very similar. In both cases, average walk lengths are equal to average stop separation. Minimum trip times, including walk, wait, in-vehicle and transfer elements, were found to occur with a station separation of around 0.5 km. Maximum average speed for the total trip was found to be around 15 km/h. The network results demonstrated that transport effectiveness increased with reducing vehicle size. Optimum vehicle capacity for 0.5 km spacing was projected to be seven passengers. This would require automatic control to be operationally effective. This makes a case for the consideration of small automatically controlled vehicles for public transport.},

@article{Glasserman1992Monotonicity,
    abstract = {We establish stochastic monotonicity of the event epoch sequences of generalized {semi-Markov} processes through the structure of the generalized {semi-Markov} schemes on which they are based. Our main condition states, roughly, that the occurrence of more events in the short run never leads to the activation of less events in the long run. We consider monotonicity with respect to two types of inputs: clock times (which translate to, e.g., service and interarrival times in queueing systems), and structural parameters (which translate to, e.g., buffer size, number of servers, and job population). For the second type of comparison, we replace a structural change with an equivalent change in clock times to reduce the comparison to one of the first type. When applied to queueing systems, our results yield new comparisons and also unify several existing results previously established using special properties of individual systems.},

@article{Glasserman1992Generalized,
    abstract = {A generalized {semi-Markov} scheme models the structure of a discrete event system, such as a network of queues. By studying combinatorial and geometric representations of schemes we find conditions for second-order properties-convexity/concavity, sub/supermodularity-of their event epochs and event counting processes. A scheme generates a language of feasible strings of events. We show that monotonicity of the event epochs is equivalent to this language forming an antimatroid with repetition. This connection gives rise to a rich combinatorial structure, and serves as a starting point for other properties. For example, by strengthening the antimatroid condition we give several equivalent characterizations of the convexity of event epochs within a scheme. All of these correspond, in slightly different ways, to making a certain score space a lattice, to closing an ordinary antimatroid under intersections. We also establish second-order properties across schemes tied together through a synchronization mechanism. A geometric view based on the score space facilitates verification of these properties in certain queueing systems.},

@article{Howard1964System,
    abstract = {Flow graph analysis has proved a valuable approach to the study of probabilistic systems. This paper extends the analytic procedures to {semi-Markov} processes, Markov processes whose transition times can also be arbitrary random variables. First we present the basic theory of the {semi-Markov} process. We derive expressions for the interval transition probabilities, the probabilities that the system will be in each state after the passage of a time interval of length t, and find the limit of these probabilities when t is large. Then we develop the flow graph interpretation of these relations. We consider the special cases of counting transitions, transient processes, and first passage times. We investigate the effect on interval transition probabilities of starting the process in different ways, including choosing a time at random to begin observation of the process. We find that results are often most conveniently expressed by the matrix flow graph for the process.},

The general results are then applied to '{S.M}.-processes', a generalization of Markov chains, and it is shown that the limiting distribution of the process may always be obtained by assuming negative-exponential distributions for the 'waits' in the different 'states'. Lastly, the behaviour of integrals of regenerative processes is considered and, amongst other results, an ergodic and a multi-dimensional central limit theorem are proved.},
